Q: Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?

A: First, let's find out how many seats are available for friends and family by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center:

6000 (total capacity) - 950 (graduates) - 300 (faculty) = 4750 seats available for friends and family

Now, let's divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive:

4750 (available seats) รท 950 (graduates) = 5 tickets per graduate

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.
