Q:In a neighborhood, the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, how many pets in total are in the neighborhood? 

A: Let's break this problem down step by step.

We are given that there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood.
We are also given that there are 2 cats for every dog. So, since there are 60 dogs, there are 2 * 60 = 120 cats.
The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 dogs + 120 cats = 180 pets.
The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.
To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 dogs + 120 cats + 168 rabbits = 348 pets.
There are 348 pets in total in the neighborhood.
