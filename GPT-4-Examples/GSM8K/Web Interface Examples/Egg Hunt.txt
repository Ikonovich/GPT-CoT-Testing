GT: 30

Q: The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?
A: The Smith twins found a total of 2 * 30 = 60 eggs. There were 100 eggs in total, and 10 eggs were not found by anyone. So the friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.
