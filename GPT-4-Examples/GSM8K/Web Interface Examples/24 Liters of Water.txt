A: Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. Then a boy got 6 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?

Q: Let's first find out how many liters of water the two girls got:

Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters, so (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters per girl.

Since there are two girls, they got a total of 2 * 4 = 8 liters.

Now, let's subtract the amount the boy got:

The boy got 6 liters of water.

Now, let's find out how many liters of water are left:

Total liters of water - (liters the girls got + liters the boy got) = Remaining liters of water

24 - (8 + 6) = 24 - 14 = 10 liters.

There were 10 liters of water left.
