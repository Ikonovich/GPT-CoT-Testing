            "Response": "First, we need to find the individual rates of Friend P and Friend Q. Let's say Friend Q's rate is x km/h. Then, Friend P's rate is 1.15x km/h (since it's 15% faster).\n\nNext, we need to find the time it takes for them to meet. Let's call this time t. Since they are walking towards each other, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: x + 1.15x = 2.15x km/h. Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up the equation:\n\n43 km = 2.15x * t\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = 43 / 2.15x\n\nNow, we can use this time to find how far Friend P has walked. Friend P's distance is their rate multiplied by the time they have walked, which is:\n\ndistance = 1.15x * t\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for t, we get:\n\ndistance = 1.15x * (43 / 2.15x) = 23 km\n\nTherefore, the answer is {E)23}.",

In this case, we want to select 2 members from a group of k, so n=k and r=2. Therefore, the total number of ways to select 2 members from the band is kC2 = k! / 2!(k-2)! = k(k-1)/2.\n\nStep 3: Find the number of ways to select 2 members from the band without Jim and Ellen.\nSince there are 6 possible combinations in which Jim and Ellen are not selected, we can say that the total number of ways to select 2 members from the remaining k-2 members is 6. Therefore, we can use the same formula as in Step 2, but with n=k-2 and r=2. This gives us (k-2)(k-3)/2 = 6.\n\nStep 4: Solve for k.\nWe can simplify the equation from Step 3 to get (k-2)(k-3) = 12. Expanding the left side gives us k^2 - 5k + 6 = 12, or k^2 - 5k - 6 = 0. Factoring gives us (k-6)(k+1) = 0, so k=6 or k=-1.

            "Response": "First, we need to know that the perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Let's call the length of one side of square P \"x\". Therefore, the perimeter of P is 4x, which we know is equal to 40. \n\n4x = 40 \n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get: \n\nx = 10 \n\nSo each side of square P has a length of 10. \n\nNow, let's think about the circle Q. Since square P is inscribed in circle Q, the diameter of Q is equal to the diagonal of P. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal of P: \n\ndiagonal^2 = x^2 + x^2 \n\ndiagonal^2 = 2x^2 \n\ndiagonal = x\u221a2 \n\nSubstituting x = 10, we get: \n\ndiagonal = 10\u221a2 \n\nThe diameter of Q is equal to the diagonal of P, so the diameter of Q is also 10\u221a2. \n\nFinally, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle: \n\ncircumference = \u03c0d \n\nSubstituting d = 10\u221a2, we get: \n\ncircumference = 10\u221a2\u03c0 \n\nTherefore, the answer is {B) 10\u221a2\u03c0}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find James' earnings for last week. Since he only earns a fixed salary of $30 per week, we can ignore the bicycle sales part of the equation. Therefore, his earnings last week were $30.\n\nNow, let's find his earnings for this week. We can break it down into three parts: the first 6 bicycles, the next 6 bicycles, and any additional bicycles sold after the first 12.\n\nFor the first 6 bicycles, he earns $6 per bicycle, so he earns 6y for those sales.\n\nFor the next 6 bicycles, he earns $12 per bicycle, so he earns 12(y-6) for those sales.\n\nFor any additional bicycles sold after the first 12, he earns $18 per bicycle, so he earns 18(y-12) for those sales.\n\nTherefore, his total earnings for this week are:\n\n6y + 12(y-6) + 18(y-12) + 30\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n36y - 186\n\nNow we can set up an inequality to represent the fact that James earned more than twice as much this week as he did last week:\n\n36y - 186 > 2(30)\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n36y > 246\n\nDividing both sides by 36, we get:\n\ny > 6.83\n\nTherefore, we know that James sold at least 7 bicycles this week. We also know that he sold x bicycles last week, but we don't have any information about the value of x.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, we can see that option E)III only must be true, since we know that James sold at least 7 bicycles this week, which is greater than 3. We can also see that option A)I,II only cannot be true, since we don't have enough information to determine whether y is less than or greater than twice x.

Therefore, the new number of classes would be 120/(Q+1). \n\nAccording to the problem, 10 fewer classes would be run if the ratio were increased. This means that:\n\n120/Q - 10 = 120/(Q+1)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n12/Q - 1 = 12/(Q+1)\n\nMultiplying both sides by Q(Q+1), we get:\n\n12(Q+1) - Q(Q+1) = 12Q\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n12 = Q^2\n\nTherefore, Q = sqrt(12) = 2sqrt(3) \n\nSince we are asked to give the answer in whole numbers, the closest option is Q=6. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {C).",

            "Response": "First, we can simplify the equation to get\nbc + ac + ab = abc\nDividing both sides by abc, we get\n1/c + 1/b + 1/a = 1/abc\nSince a, b, and c are positive integers, we know that 1/c, 1/b, and 1/a are positive fractions. Therefore, we can conclude that 1/abc is also a positive fraction, which means that abc must be greater than 1.\nNext, we can try to find some possible values for a, b, and c. Since a < b < c, we know that a must be less than or equal to 1/3 (because if a is greater than 1/3, then 1/a is less than 3, which means that the sum of 1/a, 1/b, and 1/c would be less than 1). Therefore, we can start by trying a = 1, 2, and 3.\nIf a = 1, then we have\n1/b + 1/c = 2/3\nMultiplying both sides by 3bc, we get\n3c + 3b = 2bc\nDividing both sides by 2b, we get\n3/2c + 3/2 = b\nSince b is an integer, we know that 3/2c + 3/2 must be an integer as well. Therefore, c must be even (because if c is odd, then 3/2c is not an integer). Let's try c = 4:\n3/2(4) + 3/2 = 6\nTherefore, b = 6. But this means that 1/6 + 1/4 is not equal to 2/3, so a = 1 does not work.\nIf a = 2, then we have\n1/b + 1/c = 1/6\nMultiplying both sides by 6bc, we get\n6c + 6b = bc\nDividing both sides by b, we get\n6c/b + 6 = c\nSince c is an integer, we know that 6c/b + 6 must be an integer as well. Therefore, b must be a factor of 6c - 36. Let's try b = 3:\n6c/3 + 6 = c\n2c + 6 = c\nThis is not possible, so b = 3 does not work. Let's try b = 4:\n6c/4 + 6 = c\n3c/2 + 6 = c\nc/2 = 6\nc = 12\nTherefore, b = 4 and a = 2. We can check that this works:\n1/2 + 1/4 + 1/12 = 1\nTherefore, the answer is a + b + c = 2 + 4 + 12 = 18. However, this is not one of the answer choices.\nIf a = 3, then we have\n1/b + 1/c = 1/3\nMultiplying both sides by 3bc, we get\n3c + 3b = bc\nDividing both sides by b, we get\n3c/b + 3 = c\nSince c is an integer, we know that 3c/b + 3 must be an integer as well. Therefore, b must be a factor of 3c - 9. Let's try b = 4:\n3c/4 + 3 = c\nc/4 = 3\nc = 12\nTherefore, b = 4 and a = 3. We can check that this works:\n1/3 + 1/4 + 1/12 = 1\nTherefore, the answer is a + b + c = 3 + 4 + 12 = 19. This is not one of the answer choices either.\nTherefore, we can conclude that there are no such integers that satisfy the equation. The answer is E) {no such integers exist}.",

This means that the new price (p) is less than Rs.2. \n\nThe question states that the new price was not less than half the original price quoted. So, we can write: \n\np \u2265 2/2 = 1 \n\nCombining the above two equations, we get: \n\n1 \u2264 p < 2 \n\nNow, we need to find the value of x. \n\nWe know that x chocolates were sold at the new price of p, so the total revenue from these sales can be written as: \n\nxp \n\nSubstituting the value of xp from the first equation, we get: \n\n164.90 = xp \n\nSubstituting the value of p from the inequality we derived earlier, we get: \n\n164.90 = x(1+k) \n\nwhere k is some fraction between 0 and 1. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx = 164.90/(1+k) \n\nSince x is a whole number, k must be such that 1+k is a factor of 164.90. \n\nWe can check the factors of 164.90 and see which ones satisfy the inequality 1 \u2264 1+k < 2. \n\nThe factors of 164.90 are: \n\n1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 26, 65, 130, 253, 506, 1265, 2530, 8245, 16490 \n\nOut of these, only 1.5 satisfies the inequality 1 \u2264 1+k < 2. \n\nSo, x = 164.90/(1+1.5) = 1.6 \n\nTherefore, the answer is {E) 1.6}.",

So, the amount paid for the initial 1/4 mile is:\n\n$0.34 \n\nTo figure out how much was paid for the additional distance driven, we need to subtract the amount paid for the initial 1/4 mile from the total rental charge:\n\n$1.24 - $0.34 = $0.90 \n\nNow we can use the information given about the rental charge for additional distance driven to figure out how many miles were driven beyond the initial 1/4 mile. \n\nThe rental charge for every 1/5 mile driven over the initial 1/4 mile is 6 cents, or $0.06. This means that for every 1/5 mile driven, the rental charge increases by $0.06. \n\nTo figure out how many 1/5 miles were driven beyond the initial 1/4 mile, we can set up an equation: \n\n$0.90 = $0.06 x (number of 1/5 miles driven) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n(number of 1/5 miles driven) = $0.90 / $0.06 \n\n(number of 1/5 miles driven) = 15 \n\nSo, the man drove 15 1/5 miles beyond the initial 1/4 mile. \n\nTo convert this to a total distance driven, we need to add the initial 1/4 mile: \n\nTotal distance driven = 1/4 mile + 15 1/5 miles \n\nTotal distance driven = 1/4 mile + (15 x 1/5) miles \n\nTotal distance driven = 1/4 mile + 3 miles \n\nTotal distance driven = 3 1/4 miles \n\nTherefore, the man drove {3.25} miles. \n\nThe answer is C)3.25.",

            "Response": "Let the three numbers be a, b, and c. Then we have:\n\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 351  (equation 1)\nab + ac + bc = 245  (equation 2)\n\nWe want to find the sum a + b + c. One way to do this is to use equation 1 to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other two, and then substitute into equation 2 to get a quadratic equation in one variable. We can then solve for that variable and use it to find the sum a + b + c.\n\nLet's solve equation 1 for c^2:\n\nc^2 = 351 - a^2 - b^2\n\nSubstituting this into equation 2, we get:\n\nab + a(351 - a^2 - b^2) + b(351 - a^2 - b^2) = 245\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n2ab - a^3 - b^3 + 702a - 702b = 94\n\nNow we can use the fact that a + b + c = (a + b) + c = (a + b) + sqrt(351 - a^2 - b^2). Let's call a + b = x. Then we have:\n\nc = sqrt(351 - a^2 - b^2) = sqrt(351 - x^2)\n\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\n2ab - a^3 - b^3 + 702a - 702b = 94 - x^2\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\na^3 + b^3 + (2x - 702)a + (2x - 702)b - 94 + x^2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a or b, with coefficients that depend on x. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for a or b:\n\na (or b) = (-2x + 702 \u00b1 sqrt((2x - 702)^2 - 4(1)(-94 + x^2))) / 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\na (or b) = (-x + 351 \u00b1 sqrt(245 - x^2)) \n\nNote that we took the positive square root because a and b must be positive (otherwise we could just switch their signs and get the same sum).\n\nNow we can use this formula to find a and b for different values of x, and check which values give us a sum that is an integer. We can start by trying x = 1, 2, 3, ... and see if any of them work. Alternatively, we can use the fact that a + b + c = x + sqrt(351 - x^2), and note that the expression under the square root must be positive for a, b, and c to be real. This gives us the inequality:\n\n0 < x^2 < 351\n\nThe only integer values of x that satisfy this inequality are x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. We can plug each of these values into the formula above and check which ones give us an integer sum. After some trial and error, we find that x = 13 works, giving us:\n\na = 4, b = 9, c = sqrt(351 - 4^2 - 9^2) = 8\n\nTherefore, the sum a + b + c = 4 + 9 + 8 = 21. The closest option to this is (B) 22, so our final answer is {B}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to determine how many cans each mouse can test within 24 hours. Since a person will die within 14 hours of tasting a very small amount, we can assume that a mouse will also die within 14 hours of consuming a small amount of poison. Therefore, each mouse can test a maximum of 2 cans within 24 hours (one can every 12 hours).\n\nNext, we need to determine how many rounds of testing we can do within 24 hours. Since each mouse can test 2 cans, we can divide the total number of cans (30) by 2 to get the number of rounds: 30/2 = 15 rounds.\n\nNow we need to figure out how many mice we need to ensure that we can test all 30 cans within 15 rounds. We can use a binary search approach to minimize the number of mice needed. We start by testing 2 cans with one mouse, then 4 cans with two mice, then 8 cans with three mice, and so on, until we can test all 30 cans within 15 rounds.\n\nHere's how the binary search would work:\n\n- Round 1: Test cans 1 and 2 with one mouse. If the mouse dies, we know can 1 is poisoned. If the mouse survives, we know can 1 is safe and can move on to round 2.\n- Round 2: Test cans 3-6 with two mice. If both mice die, we know one of the four cans (3, 4, 5, or 6) is poisoned. If both mice survive, we know all four cans are safe and can move on to round 3.\n- Round 3: Test cans 7-14 with three mice. If all three mice die, we know one of the eight cans (7-14) is poisoned. If all three mice survive, we know all eight cans are safe and can move on to round 4.\n- Round 4: Test cans 15-30 with four mice. If all four mice survive, we know the poisoned can is one of the first 14 cans (1-14). We can then test these 14 cans with the remaining mice until we find the poisoned can.\n\nTherefore, we need a total of 4 mice to test all 30 cans within 24 hours. \n\nAnswer: {4}",

Therefore, the total volume of the first jar is 9x units. \n\nStep 2: Find the total volume of milk and water in the second jar.\nLet's assume that the second jar contains 2y units of milk and y units of water. Therefore, the total volume of the second jar is 3y units. \n\nStep 3: Find the ratio of milk to water in the third jar.\nThe third jar needs to have a milk to water ratio of 1:1. Therefore, we need to add equal amounts of milk and water to the third jar. \n\nStep 4: Find the total volume of milk and water needed for the third jar.\nSince we need equal amounts of milk and water, we need 15 liters of each. Therefore, the total volume of the third jar is 30 liters. \n\nStep 5: Find the amount of milk needed from the first jar.\nLet's assume that we need to take out y liters of milk from the first jar. Therefore, the new volume of milk in the first jar is 5x - y. \n\nStep 6: Find the amount of water needed from the second jar.\nSince we need to add 15 liters of water to the third jar, we need to take out 15 - y liters of water from the second jar. Therefore, the new volume of water in the second jar is y - (15 - y) = 2y - 15. \n\nStep 7: Set up an equation for the milk to water ratio in the third jar.\nThe total volume of milk in the third jar is 5x - y, and the total volume of water in the third jar is 15 - y. Therefore, the milk to water ratio in the third jar is:\n\n(5x - y) : (15 - y)\n\nSince we need a ratio of 1:1, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(5x - y) : (15 - y) = 1 : 1\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n5x - y = 15 - y\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n5x = 15\n\nx = 3\n\nStep 8: Find the amount of milk needed from the first jar (continued).\nNow that we know the value of x, we can find the amount of milk needed from the first jar. \n\nWe assumed earlier that we need to take out y liters of milk from the first jar. Therefore, the new volume of milk in the first jar is:\n\n5x - y = 5(3) - y = 15 - y\n\nWe need the milk to water ratio in the first jar to be 5:4. Therefore, the ratio of milk to water in the first jar is:\n\n15 - y : 4y\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n\n(15 - y) : 4y = 5 : 4\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n60y - 4y^2 = 75 - 5y\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n4y^2 - 65y + 75 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\ny = (65 \u00b1 sqrt(65^2 - 4*4*75)) / (2*4) \n\ny = (65 \u00b1 35) / 8\n\ny = 10 or y = 5/2\n\nSince we need to take out y liters of milk from the first jar, and y cannot be greater than 10 (otherwise we would be taking out more milk than there is in the jar), the only possible value for y is 5/2. \n\nTherefore, the amount of milk needed from the first jar is:\n\n15 - y = 15 - 5/2 = 25/2 = 12.5 liters\n\nThe answer is {A)7.5 l}.",

This circle can intersect each of the first two circles at a maximum of 2 points each, for a total of 4 points. However, it is also possible that the third circle does not intersect either of the first two circles at all. \n\nContinuing in this way, we can see that each additional circle can intersect the previous circles at a maximum of 2 points each, but it is also possible that it does not intersect any of the previous circles. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of points of intersection occurs when all 15 circles intersect at 2 points each. This would give a total of 2 x 15 = 30 points of intersection. \n\nHowever, we need to be careful because it is possible for some of the circles to intersect at the same points. For example, if two circles intersect at the origin, and a third circle also passes through the origin, then it will intersect the first two circles at the same two points. \n\nTo find the maximum number of distinct points of intersection, we need to count the number of unique intersection points. This can be done by considering each pair of circles and finding their intersection points, then removing any duplicates. \n\nThere are ${15 \\choose 2} = 105$ pairs of circles, so we need to find the maximum number of distinct intersection points among these pairs. \n\nEach pair of circles can intersect at a maximum of 2 points, so the total number of intersection points among all pairs is at most 2 x 105 = 210. \n\nHowever, it is possible for some of these intersection points to be duplicates. To find the maximum number of distinct intersection points, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where all intersection points are duplicates. \n\nIn this case, each pair of circles intersects at the same 2 points, so there are only 2 distinct intersection points among all pairs. Therefore, the maximum number of distinct intersection points is 2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }210}$.",

So we can eliminate option E.\n\nNow let's consider option B, which is 159. We can write this as G + H = 159. If we let G be 90, then H would be 69 (since we halve each digit of 90 to get 45, which we add to 90 to get 135, and then subtract from 159 to get 69). And 90 is a valid two-digit number, so option B is possible.\n\nLet's move on to option C, which is 137. We can write this as G + H = 137. If we let G be 80, then H would be 57.5, which is not a valid two-digit number. If we let G be 70, then H would be 52.5, which is also not a valid two-digit number. So option C is not possible.\n\nFinally, let's consider option D, which is 121. We can write this as G + H = 121.

            "Response": "First, we need to determine the number of possible 5-digit numbers that can be formed using these digits. Since all digits are distinct, we can use the permutation formula:\n\nP(7,5) = 7!/(7-5)! = 7x6x5x4x3 = 2520\n\nThis means there are 2520 possible 5-digit numbers that can be formed using these digits.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these numbers are greater than 1 lac (100,000). Since the first digit cannot be 0, we have 6 choices for the first digit (2, 3, or 4 for the thousands place, and any of the remaining 6 digits for the units, tens, and hundreds places). For the remaining 4 digits, we have 6 choices for each digit (since we cannot repeat any of the digits already used). Therefore, the total number of 5-digit numbers greater than 1 lac that can be formed using these digits is:\n\n6x6x6x6x6 = 7776\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the number of 5-digit numbers that are less than or equal to 1 lac. There are 90000 such numbers (ranging from 00000 to 99999), and we already counted the numbers that start with 0 (which is not allowed for numbers greater than 1 lac). Therefore, the total number of 5-digit numbers that are less than or equal to 1 lac is:\n\n90000 - 6x6x6x6x5 = 90000 - 5400 = 84600\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n7776 - 84600 = -76824\n\nSince this is a negative number, there are no 5-digit numbers greater than 1 lac that can be formed using these digits.

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the composition of chemical X and chemical Y\nChemical X is prepared by mixing A and B in the ratio of 1:3, so the composition of X is 1/4 A and 3/4 B.\nChemical Y is prepared by mixing B and C in the ratio of 2:1, so the composition of Y is 2/3 B and 1/3 C.\n\nStep 2: Find the composition of product M\nProduct M is produced by mixing X and Y in the ratio of 5:4, so the composition of M is:\n(5/9) * (1/4) A + (5/9) * (3/4) B + (4/9) * (2/3) B + (4/9) * (1/3) C\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n5/36 A + 5/9 B + 4/27 C\n\nStep 3: Find the amount of raw material B in 864 units of product M\nThe concentration of raw material B in product M is 5/9 * 3/4 + 4/9 * 2/3 = 5/9, which means that there are 5/9 * 864 = 480 units of B in 864 units of product M.\n\nStep 4: Find the amount of water added to product M\nLet's assume that x units of water were added to 864 units of product M. Then the total volume of the final mixture is 864 + x units. Since the concentration of B in the final mixture is 50%, we know that the amount of B in the final mixture is equal to the amount of water added:\n480 = x\nTherefore, the amount of water added to product M is 480 units, which corresponds to option {D}.",

            "Response": "Step 1: Determine the number of ways to award the medals.\nThere are 4 choices for the first-place runner, 3 choices for the second-place runner (since one person has already received a medal), and 2 choices for the third-place runner. This gives a total of 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 possible ways to award the medals.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of ways to form a victory circle.\nThere are 3 people in the victory circle, and each person can hold one of 3 different medals (gold, silver, or bronze). This gives a total of 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 possible ways to form a victory circle.\n\nStep 3: Account for ties.\nIf there is a tie for first place, there are 3 ways to award the gold medal (to either of the tied runners, or to both). If there is a tie for second place, there are 2 ways to award the silver medal (to either of the tied runners). If there is a tie for third place, there is only 1 way to award the bronze medal (to both tied runners). Therefore, we need to add the number of ways to award the medals in case of ties.\n\n- If there is a two-way tie for first place, there are 3 ways to award the gold medal, and 2 ways to award the silver medal. This gives a total of 3 x 2 = 6 possible victory circles.\n- If there is a two-way tie for second place, there are 4 ways to award the silver medal, and 2 ways to award the bronze medal. This gives a total of 4 x 2 = 8 possible victory circles.\n- If there is a two-way tie for third place, there are 4 ways to award the bronze medal. This gives a total of 4 possible victory circles.\n\nAdding up all the possibilities, we get a total of 24 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 42 possible victory circles. Therefore, the answer is {42}.",

So the combined rate is:\n\n1/20 + 1/30 = 3/60 + 2/60 = 5/60 = 1/12\n\nSo together, X and Y can complete 1/12 of the work per day.\n\nStep 3: Find the time required to complete the work.\n\nLet's call the number of days required to complete the work \"d\". We want to solve for \"d\".\n\nWe know that the combined rate of X and Y is 1/12 of the work per day. So in \"d\" days, they will complete:\n\n1/12 \u00d7 d = d/12 of the work\n\nBut we also know that X can complete the entire work in 20 days, and Y can complete the entire work in 30 days. So in \"d\" days, X will complete:\n\nd/20 of the work\n\nAnd in \"d\" days, Y will complete:\n\nd/30 of the work\n\nSo the total amount of work completed in \"d\" days is:\n\nd/12 + d/20 + d/30\n\nWe can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator:\n\nd/12 + d/20 + d/30 = (5d/60) + (3d/60) + (2d/60) = 10d/60 = d/6\n\nSo in \"d\" days, X and Y will complete d/6 of the work.\n\nBut we know that the entire work is 1.

            "Response": "First, we need to determine how many non-union members there are in Company A. We can do this by subtracting the number of union members from the total number of employees: \n\n13 - 9 = 4 \n\nSo there are 4 non-union members in Company A. \n\nNext, we need to consider the different combinations of employees that could work any given shift. We know that 5 people work each shift, and at least 4 of them must be union members. \n\nWe can break this down into two cases: \n\nCase 1: All 5 employees are union members \n\nIn this case, we simply need to choose 5 union members from the 9 available. We can do this using the combination formula: \n\nC(9,5) = 126 \n\nSo there are 126 different combinations of 5 union members who could work a shift. \n\nCase 2: 4 union members and 1 non-union member \n\nIn this case, we need to choose 4 union members from the 9 available, and 1 non-union member from the 4 available. We can do this using the product of two combination formulas: \n\nC(9,4) * C(4,1) = 126 * 4 = 504 \n\nSo there are 504 different combinations of 4 union members and 1 non-union member who could work a shift. \n\nAdding up the two cases, we get: \n\n126 + 504 = 630 \n\nSo there are 630 different combinations of employees who could work any given shift. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {630}.",

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the number of cats and dogs in the shelter on Monday.\nSince we don't know the ratio of cats to dogs, we'll use variables. Let c be the number of cats and d be the number of dogs on Monday. We know that:\n\nc + d = 45\n\nStep 2: Find the number of pets adopted by Friday.\nWe're told that 1/5 of the cats and 1/4 of the dogs were adopted. Let's use fractions to represent this:\n\n1/5c cats were adopted\n1/4d dogs were adopted\n\nTo find the total number of pets adopted, we add these two fractions:\n\n1/5c + 1/4d\n\nBut we don't know the values of c and d. However, we can use the fact that c + d = 45 to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for c:\n\nc + d = 45\nc = 45 - d\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for c into our equation for the number of pets adopted:\n\n1/5c + 1/4d = 1/5(45 - d) + 1/4d\n= 9 - 1/5d + 1/4d\n= 9 + 1/20d\n\nStep 3: Find the greatest possible number of pets adopted.\nWe want to maximize the expression 9 + 1/20d. Since d is a positive integer, the largest possible value for 1/20d is 1/20 times the largest possible value of d. The largest possible value of d is 45 (if all the cats were adopted and none of the dogs), so the largest possible value of 1/20d is 1/20 times 45, or 9/2.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of 9 + 1/20d is 9 + 9/2, or 27/2. Since we can't have a fraction of a pet, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 13.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {D)13}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the prime factorization of 450: $450=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5^2$. Since $n^2$ is divisible by 450, we know that $n^2$ must have at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. \n\nTo find the largest positive integer that must divide $n$, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in $n^2$. Since $n^2$ has at least one factor of 2, we know that $n$ must have at least one factor of 2. \n\nSimilarly, since $n^2$ has two factors of 3, we know that $n$ must have at least one factor of 3. But $n$ could also have a factor of 9 (which would give $n^2$ four factors of 3), so the largest power of 3 that must divide $n$ is 9. \n\nFinally, since $n^2$ has two factors of 5, we know that $n$ must have at least one factor of 5.

A person opens both the pipes together when the cistern should have been was full he finds the waste pipe open. He then closes the waste pipe and in another 4 minutes the cistern was full. In what time can the waste pipe empty the cistern when fill?\nOptions:  A)6 B)8 C)7 D)4 E)1 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, we need to find the rate of filling of each pipe. Pipe A can fill the cistern in 10 minutes, so its rate of filling is 1/10. Similarly, pipe B can fill the cistern in 15 minutes, so its rate of filling is 1/15.\n\nWhen both pipes are opened together, their combined rate of filling is the sum of their individual rates, which is 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6. This means that both pipes together can fill the cistern in 6 minutes.\n\nNow, let's consider the time when the waste pipe was open. During this time, the water was flowing out of the cistern at a certain rate, which we need to find. Let's assume that the waste pipe can empty the cistern in x minutes. Then, its rate of emptying is 1/x.\n\nWhen all three pipes are open, the net rate of filling is the difference between the rate of filling and the rate of emptying. So, we have:\n\n1/6 - 1/x = 1/((4+x)/60)\n\nHere, we have converted the time of 4 minutes to hours (4/60) and used the formula:\n\ntime = work/rate\n\nwhere work is the amount of water to be filled (which is 1) and rate is the net rate of filling.\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\n1/x = 1/10 - 1/((4+x)/60)\n\n1/x = 1/10 - 60/(4+x)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10x(4+x), we get:\n\n10(4+x) - 60x = x(4+x)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n40 + 10x - 60x = x^2 + x\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nx^2 - 49x - 40 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get:\n\nx = (49 \u00b1 sqrt(49^2 + 4*40))/2\n\nx = (49 \u00b1 61)/2\n\nx = 55/2 or x = -6/2\n\nSince x cannot be negative, we reject the second solution and get:\n\nx = 55/2\n\nTherefore, the waste pipe can empty the cistern in 55/2 minutes or approximately 27.5 minutes. \n\nAnswer: {7}",

If Harry is the secretary, then there are 13 choices for the president and 12 choices for the treasurer, for a total of 13 x 12 = 156 possibilities. If Harry is the treasurer, then there are 13 choices for the president and 12 choices for the secretary, for a total of another 156 possibilities. However, we have counted the case where Harry is both the secretary and the treasurer twice, so we need to subtract this case once. If Harry is both the secretary and the treasurer, then there are 13 choices for the president, so there is only 13 x 1 = 13 possibility.

The profit on each of these books was 1.8W - W = 0.8W. So the total profit on these 150 books was 150 x 0.8W = 120W.\n\nThe store then sold the next 100 copies at 20% more than W, which means they sold them at a price of 1.2W. The profit on each of these books was 1.2W - W = 0.2W. So the total profit on these 100 books was 100 x 0.2W = 20W.\n\nThe store had 150 + 100 = 250 books left to sell. They sold these to a bargain retailer at 40% less than W, which means they sold them at a price of 0.6W. The loss on each of these books was W - 0.6W = 0.4W. So the total loss on these 250 books was 250 x 0.4W = 100W.\n\nThe store's total profit or loss was the difference between their total revenue and their total cost. Their total revenue was 150 x 1.8W + 100 x 1.2W + 250 x 0.6W = 540W. Their total cost was 400W. So their net profit or loss was 540W - 400W = 140W.\n\nTo find the percent profit or loss, we need to divide the net profit or loss by the total cost and multiply by 100%. So the percent profit or loss is:\n\n(140W / 400W) x 100% = 35%\n\nBut we need to remember that the question is asking for the net percent profit or loss on the entire lot of 400 books. So we need to express the answer as a percentage of the total revenue, which is:\n\n(140W / 540W) x 100% = 25.93%\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n{26% profit}",

            "Response": "After 21 hours, tank B is 1/32 filled, which means it has $\\frac{1}{32} \\times 160 = 5$ liters of water. This means that in the first 21 hours, tank B was filled with $160-5=155$ liters of water. \n\nWe know that tank A fills at a rate of 1 liter per hour, so in the same 21 hours, tank A would have been filled with 21 liters of water. \n\nTherefore, the total amount of water filled in both tanks in 21 hours is 21+155=176 liters. \n\nTo fill tank B completely, we need a total of 1+2+4+8+...+256=511 liters of water. \n\nSubtracting the 176 liters already filled, we need to fill 335 liters more. \n\nTank A can fill 1 liter per hour, so it will take 335 hours to fill the remaining water in tank B. \n\nHowever, we also need to consider the increasing rate of tank B. We can see that tank B doubles its amount of water every hour. So, if it has 5 liters after 21 hours, it will have 10 liters after 22 hours, 20 liters after 23 hours, 40 liters after 24 hours, and so on. \n\nWe need to find the hour at which tank B will have 335 liters of water.

So, the average number of cows per month is 560/10 = 56 cows.\n\nSince A is putting in 80 cows, he is paying for 80/56 = 1.43 times the average number of cows per month.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much B needs to pay. Since B is renting the pasture for 3 months, he needs to pay for 3/10 = 0.3 of the total rental period.\n\nSince B is paying half as much again as A, he is paying 1.5 times what A is paying. So, we can calculate B's payment as:\n\n1.5 x 1.43 x 56 x 3 = 608\n\nTherefore, B can put in 608/56 = 10.86 cows for the remaining 3 months.

            "Response": "Let's assume that the distance between P and Q is x km. \nWhen the two trains meet, they would have covered the entire distance between P and Q. \nLet's say the first train has covered y km before they meet. \nTherefore, the second train would have covered (x-y) km before they meet. \nWe know that the first train has travelled 100 km more than the second train. \nSo, y = (x-y) + 100 \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n2y = x + 100 \nNow, we can use the formula: \nTime = Distance/Speed \nLet's calculate the time taken by the first train to cover y km: \nTime taken by first train = y/50 \nSimilarly, time taken by the second train to cover (x-y) km: \nTime taken by second train = (x-y)/40 \nSince they both start at the same time and meet each other, their times should be equal. \nTherefore, we can equate the two equations: \ny/50 = (x-y)/40 \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n4y = 5x - 500 \nNow, we have two equations: \n2y = x + 100 \n4y = 5x - 500 \nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to get the value of x: \nMultiplying the first equation by 5, we get: \n10y = 5x + 500 \nSubstituting this value of 10y in the second equation, we get: \n5x + 500 = 5x - 500 \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n1000 = 0 \nThis is not possible. \nTherefore, there is no solution to this problem. \nThe answer is {E) None}.",

To do this, we can consider four cases:\n\nCase 1: x and y are both positive\nIn this case, the maximum value of xy occurs when x and y are both as large as possible, i.e. x=3 and y=9. The minimum value of xy occurs when x and y are both as small as possible, i.e. x=1 and y=2. Therefore, the maximum possible value of xy is 27 and the minimum possible value of xy is 2.\n\nCase 2: x is positive and y is negative\nIn this case, the maximum value of xy occurs when x is as large as possible and y is as small as possible, i.e. x=3 and y=-7. The minimum value of xy occurs when x is as small as possible and y is as large as possible, i.e. x=1 and y=-5. Therefore, the maximum possible value of xy is -21 and the minimum possible value of xy is -5.\n\nCase 3: x is negative and y is positive\nThis case is symmetric to Case 2, so the maximum and minimum possible values of xy are the same: the maximum occurs when x is as small as possible and y is as large as possible, i.e. x=-5 and y=9, and the minimum occurs when x is as large as possible and y is as small as possible, i.e. x=-3 and y=2. Therefore, the maximum and minimum possible values of xy are 45 and -6, respectively.\n\nCase 4: x and y are both negative\nIn this case, the maximum value of xy occurs when x and y are both as small as possible, i.e. x=-5 and y=-7. The minimum value of xy occurs when x and y are both as large as possible, i.e. x=-3 and y=-5. Therefore, the maximum possible value of xy is 35 and the minimum possible value of xy is 15.\n\nTaking all four cases into account, we see that the sum of the maximum possible value of xy and the minimum possible value of xy is:\n\n$27+2+(-21)+(-5)+45+(-6)+35+15 = \\boxed{96}$",

We know that the ratio of x to y is 3 to 5, so we can write:\n\nx/y = 3/5\n\nWe also know that each quantity is increased by 6, so the new quantities are x+6 and y+6. We want to find the ratio of these new quantities, so we can write:\n\n(x+6)/(y+6) = ?\n\nTo solve for this ratio, we can use the fact that x/y = 3/5. We can cross-multiply to get:\n\n5x = 3y\n\nThen we can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other:\n\nx = (3/5)y\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x into our equation for the new ratio:\n\n(x+6)/(y+6) = ((3/5)y+6)/(y+6)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n(x+6)/(y+6) = (3y+30)/(5y+30)\n\nNow we can simplify further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n(x+6)/(y+6) = (y+10)/(5y+10)\n\nFinally, we can substitute our expression for x in terms of y:\n\n((3/5)y+6)/(y+6) = (y+10)/(5y+10)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (5y+10)(y+6), we get:\n\n3(5y+10) = (y+10)(y+6)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n15y + 30 = y^2 + 16y + 60\n\nRearranging and simplifying, we get:\n\ny^2 + y - 30 = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(y+6)(y-5) = 0\n\nSo y = -6 or y = 5. But since we're dealing with quantities, we can't have a negative value, so y = 5.

            "Response": "First, we need to set up an equation to find the day when the prices are equal.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the positions of the hour and minute hands at 3.40. \n\nThe hour hand will be pointing between 3 and 4, and since it takes 12 hours for the hour hand to complete a full rotation of 360 degrees, it moves 30 degrees per hour. At 3.40, the hour hand will have moved 3.4 hours x 30 degrees per hour = 102 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. \n\nThe minute hand will be pointing at the 8 on the clock face, since it takes 60 minutes for the minute hand to complete a full rotation of 360 degrees, it moves 6 degrees per minute. At 3.40, the minute hand will have moved 40 minutes x 6 degrees per minute = 240 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. \n\nNow we can find the angle between the hour and minute hands. \n\nWe know that the hour hand is 102 degrees from the 12 o'clock position, and the minute hand is 240 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. \n\nTo find the angle between them, we can subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle. \n\nIn this case, the smaller angle is the angle between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock position, which is 102 degrees. The larger angle is the angle between the minute hand and the 12 o'clock position, which is 240 degrees. \n\nSo the angle between the hour and minute hands is 240 degrees - 102 degrees = 138 degrees. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the angle at 3.40, not the angle between the hour and minute hands. \n\nWe know that the hour hand is 102 degrees from the 12 o'clock position, which means it is 30 degrees away from the 3 o'clock position. \n\nSo the angle between the hour hand and the 3 o'clock position is 30 degrees. \n\nThe minute hand is pointing at the 8 on the clock face, which means it is 40 minutes away from the 12 o'clock position. \n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find the angle between the minute hand and the 12 o'clock position by multiplying 360 degrees by the fraction of the hour that has passed. \n\nIn this case, 40 minutes is 2/3 of an hour, so the angle between the minute hand and the 12 o'clock position is 360 degrees x 2/3 = 240 degrees. \n\nNow we can find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3.40 by subtracting the smaller angle from the larger angle. \n\nThe smaller angle is the angle between the hour hand and the 3 o'clock position, which is 30 degrees. The larger angle is the angle between the minute hand and the 12 o'clock position, which is 240 degrees. \n\nSo the angle between the hour and minute hands at 3.40 is 240 degrees - 30 degrees = 210 degrees. \n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match 210 degrees. \n\nWe can see that answer choice D) 135 degrees is the closest to 210 degrees, but it is not the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E) None.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the value of y in terms of z. If y is 60 percent less than z, then y is equal to 0.4z (100% - 60% = 40%, which is the same as 0.4 as a decimal). \n\nNext, we need to find the value of x in terms of y. If x is 20 percent more than y, then x is equal to 1.2y (100% + 20% = 120%, which is the same as 1.2 as a decimal). \n\nNow we can substitute the value of y in terms of z into the equation for x: \n\nx = 1.2y \nx = 1.2(0.4z) \nx = 0.48z \n\nSo x is 48% of z. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {B) 48%}.",

Simplifying this, we get 2x + y + z = 150.\n\nTo find the average mark obtained by him in Chemistry and Mathematics, we need to find (y+z)/2.\n\nWe know that 2x + y + z = 150. Adding y+z to both sides, we get 2x + 2(y+z) = 150 + (y+z). Simplifying this, we get 2(x+y+z) = 150 + (y+z).\n\nSubstituting 2(x+y+z) with 2(3x+y+z) (since we know 3x+y+z = x+150), we get 2(3x+y+z) = 150 + (y+z). Simplifying this, we get 6x + 2y + 2z = 150 + y + z.

Then, we can write:\nTotal score of all students / Number of students = Average score of the class\nUsing this formula, we get:\n(6*50 + x*60) / y = 55\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n300 + 60x = 55y\n\nStep 2: Use the fact that there are 6 boys in the class.\nWe know that the average score of boys is 50. Therefore, the total score of all boys is:\n6 * 50 = 300\nWe can subtract this from the total score of all students to get the total score of all girls:\nTotal score of all girls = Total score of all students - Total score of all boys\nTotal score of all girls = (6*50 + x*60) - 300\nTotal score of all girls = 60x - 180\n\nStep 3: Use the fact that the average score of girls is 60.\nWe know that the average score of girls is 60.

This assumption makes sense because it allows for an equal number of boys and girls in the class. Using this assumption, we can write:\ny = 12\n\nStep 5: Use the new assumption to solve for x.\nUsing our new assumption, we can rewrite the equation we got in Step 1 as:\n300 + 60x = 55*12\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n300 + 60x = 660\n60x = 360\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, the value of x is {6}.

David starts at the 11th floor and Albert starts at the 51st floor, so they are initially 51 - 11 = 40 floors apart.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to figure out when they will meet. Let's call the time it takes for them to meet t. David will have traveled 57t floors and Albert will have traveled 63t floors. The sum of these distances must equal the initial distance between them, which is 40 floors. So we can write:\n\n57t + 63t = 40\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n120t = 40\n\nt = 1/3\n\nSo they will meet after 1/3 of a minute, or 20 seconds. In that time, David will have traveled 57 x 1/3 = 19 floors and Albert will have traveled 63 x 1/3 = 21 floors. So they will meet at the 51st floor - 21 floors = 30th floor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {C)30}.",

However, we need to take into account the return journey, which has a lower average speed of 30 m/h. Let's assume that the person spends the same amount of time driving on the return journey.

There are several ways to do this, but one method is to use the fact that there are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, and only one of them results in an 8 (namely, rolling a 4 on each die). Therefore, the probability of rolling an 8 on the first try is 1/36.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of rolling the same number on the second try as on the first. There are several ways to do this as well, but one method is to use the fact that there are 6 possible outcomes for each die roll, and therefore 6x6=36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice twice. Of these, there are 6 outcomes where the first roll is a 1, 6 outcomes where the first roll is a 2, and so on, up to 6 outcomes where the first roll is a 6. For each of these outcomes, there is only 1 outcome where the second roll is the same as the first (namely, rolling the same number again). Therefore, the total number of outcomes where Taequan wins is 6, and the probability of winning is 6/36=1/6.\n\nFinally, we need to find the probability of rolling an 8 on the first try and then winning on the second try. To do this, we can multiply the probabilities of the two events: P(8 on first try) x P(winning on second try given 8 on first try) = (1/36) x (1/6) = 1/216.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {D)1/6}.",

We know that:\n\n$$\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nWe also know that the surface area of a cone is given by:\n\n$$A = \\pi r \\ell$$\n\nwhere $r$ is the radius and $\\ell$ is the slant height. We want to find the ratio of the lengths of the wires used to make the two cones. Let's call these lengths $L_1$ and $L_2$, respectively.\n\nWe can start by using the ratio of the volumes to find the ratio of the heights of the cones. The volume of a cone is given by:\n\n$$V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$$\n\nSo we have:\n\n$$\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r_1^2 h_1}{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r_2^2 h_2} = \\frac{h_1}{h_2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{h_1}{h_2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10}}$$\n\nNow we can use the ratio of the radii to find the actual values of the radii.

There are 15 cities to choose from for the first city, and 14 cities to choose from for the second city (since we can't choose the same city twice). However, since the order in which we choose the cities doesn't matter, we need to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting. Therefore, there are $\\frac{15 \\times 14}{2} = 105$ ways to choose two cities to connect with a road segment.\n\nNext, we need to connect the remaining 13 cities to the two cities we just connected. Each of the 13 cities can be connected to either of the two cities we just connected, so there are 2 choices for each of the 13 cities. Therefore, there are $2^{13}$ ways to connect the remaining cities.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted some cases. Specifically, we have counted cases where two or more of the remaining cities are connected to the same city with a single road segment. To avoid this, we need to count the number of ways to choose a set of 2 or more cities to connect to the same city, and subtract this from our total count.\n\nThere are $\\binom{13}{2}$ ways to choose a set of 2 cities to connect to the same city, and $\\binom{13}{3}$ ways to choose a set of 3 cities to connect to the same city, and so on, up to $\\binom{13}{13}$ ways to choose all 13 cities to connect to the same city. Therefore, the total number of ways to overcount is:\n\n$$\\binom{13}{2} + \\binom{13}{3} + \\cdots + \\binom{13}{13}$$\n\nThis sum can be simplified using the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}$, which gives:\n\n$$\\binom{13}{2} + \\binom{13}{3} + \\cdots + \\binom{13}{13} = \\binom{12}{1} + \\binom{12}{2} + \\cdots + \\binom{12}{12}$$\n\nThis is the sum of the second row of Pascal's triangle, which is $2^{12} - 1$.

We also know that the median capacity is 10 gallons. This means that two of the barrels have a capacity of 10 gallons or more, and two of the barrels have a capacity of 10 gallons or less.\n3. Let's assume that the smallest barrel Q has a capacity of x gallons. Since two of the barrels have a capacity of 10 gallons or less, the total capacity of these two barrels is 2 x 10 = 20 gallons or less.\n4. Therefore, the total capacity of the other two barrels (which have a capacity of 10 gallons or more) must be 32 - 20 = 12 gallons or more.\n5. Let's assume that the other three barrels have capacities of a, b, and c gallons (in ascending order). We know that the median capacity is 10 gallons, so b = 10.\n6. We also know that the average capacity is 8 gallons, so (a + b + c + x)/4 = 8. Simplifying this equation, we get a + c + x = 24 - b = 14.\n7. We want to find the maximum possible value of x. Since a, b, and c are all greater than or equal to 10, we can assume that a = 10 and c = 10. Therefore, x + 20 = 14, which means that x = -6.\n8.

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the position of the hour hand\nAt 4:00, the hour hand is at 4 on the clock face. Since 18 minutes have passed, the hour hand has moved a fraction of the way between 4 and 5. There are 60 minutes between each hour mark, so the hour hand has moved $\\frac{18}{60}=\\frac{3}{10}$ of the way from 4 to 5. Therefore, the position of the hour hand is at $4+\\frac{3}{10}=4.3$ on the clock face.\n\nStep 2: Find the position of the minute hand\nAt 18 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is at 6 on the clock face. Therefore, the position of the minute hand is at 6 on the clock face.\n\nStep 3: Find the angle between the hands\nTo find the angle between the hands, we need to find the difference between their positions. Since the clock face has 12 hours, the angle between each hour mark is $360^\\circ/12=30^\\circ$. Therefore, each minute mark is $30^\\circ/60=0.5^\\circ$ apart. \n\nThe hour hand is at 4.3, which is $4.3\\times 30^\\circ=129^\\circ$ from the 12 o'clock mark. The minute hand is at 6, which is $6\\times 30^\\circ=180^\\circ$ from the 12 o'clock mark. \n\nThe angle between the hands is the absolute difference between their positions, which is $|129^\\circ-180^\\circ|=51^\\circ$. However, since we are looking for the acute angle between the hands, we take the smaller angle formed by the hands, which is $360^\\circ-51^\\circ=309^\\circ$. \n\nTherefore, the measure of the acute angle between the hour and minute hands of the clock at 4:18 is $\\boxed{21^\\circ}$.",

This means we want to find the scenario where we remove the least number of books but still end up with 80 books on the same science.\n\nFirst, let's consider the worst-case scenario where we remove all the books except for one science. In this case, we would need to remove a total of 50+75+90+50+110 = 375 books. However, we don't need to remove all the books to ensure that 80 of them are on the same science.\n\nNext, let's consider the scenario where we remove all the books on four of the sciences, leaving only one science with books remaining. In this case, we would need to remove a total of 50+75+90+50 = 265 books. However, we still don't need to remove this many books.\n\nTo minimize the number of books we need to remove, we want to keep as many sciences as possible while still ensuring that 80 books are on the same science. Let's start by keeping all five sciences and removing books randomly. The worst-case scenario would be if we remove 79 books from each science, leaving only one book remaining in each science. At this point, we would need to remove one more book to ensure that we have 80 books on the same science.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the total productivity ratio of the three workers. We can do this by adding their individual ratios: 2 + 5 + 9 = 16. This means that for every 16 units of work done, the three workers contribute 2, 5, and 9 units respectively.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how much work the three workers can do in 4 hours. Let's assume that they can do a total of 16 units of work in 4 hours. This means that the fastest worker can do 2 units of work in 4 hours, the middle worker can do 5 units of work in 4 hours, and the slowest worker can do 9 units of work in 4 hours.\n\nNow, let's look at what happens when the slowest worker takes a break at the beginning of the 5th hour. At this point, the fastest and middle workers continue working, but the total productivity ratio drops to 7 (2 + 5). This means that for every 7 units of work done, the fastest worker contributes 2 units and the middle worker contributes 5 units.\n\nThe slowest worker comes back to work at the beginning of the 9th hour, which means that he was on break for 4 hours. During this time, the fastest and middle workers continued working and contributed a total of 28 units of work (7 units per hour x 4 hours). When the slowest worker comes back, the total productivity ratio goes back up to 16, and the three workers continue working until the job is done.\n\nSince the job is done in 10 hours, this means that the three workers worked together for a total of 6 hours (4 hours before the break + 2 hours after the break). During this time, the fastest worker contributed 2 units of work per hour, the middle worker contributed 5 units of work per hour, and the slowest worker contributed 9 units of work per hour.\n\nTo find the ratio of the work performed by the fastest worker as compared to the slowest, we need to compare the total work done by each worker. The fastest worker worked for a total of 6 hours and contributed 12 units of work (2 units per hour x 6 hours). The slowest worker worked for a total of 2 hours before the break and 4 hours after the break, for a total of 6 hours, and contributed 54 units of work (9 units per hour x 6 hours).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the work performed by the fastest worker as compared to the slowest is 12 to 1, or {A).",

            "Response": "First, we need to find David's earnings for last week. Since he only earns a fixed salary of $40 per week, we can ignore the bicycle sales part of the equation. Therefore, his earnings last week were $40.\n\nNow, let's find his earnings for this week. We can break it down into three parts: the first 6 bicycles, the next 6 bicycles, and any additional bicycles sold after that.\n\nFor the first 6 bicycles, he earns $6 per bicycle. Therefore, his earnings for the first 6 bicycles are 6y.\n\nFor the next 6 bicycles, he earns $12 per bicycle. Therefore, his earnings for the next 6 bicycles are 12(y-6) = 12y - 72.\n\nFor any additional bicycles sold after the first 12, he earns $18 per bicycle. Therefore, his earnings for any additional bicycles sold after the first 12 are 18(y-12) = 18y - 216.\n\nAdding all three parts together, we get David's total earnings for this week: 6y + 12y - 72 + 18y - 216 = 36y - 288.\n\nWe know that David earned more than twice as much as he did last week, so we can set up the following inequality:\n\n36y - 288 > 2(40)\n36y - 288 > 80\n36y > 368\ny > 10.22\n\nTherefore, we know that David sold more than 10.22 bicycles this week.

            "Response": "Let's say that Company S produced a total of 3x stereos last month. Then, 2x of them were basic and x of them were deluxe. \n\nNow, we know that it takes 1.2 times as many hours to produce a deluxe stereo as it does to produce a basic stereo. Let's say it takes y hours to produce a basic stereo. Then, it takes 1.2y hours to produce a deluxe stereo. \n\nThe total number of hours it took to produce all the basic stereos is 2xy, and the total number of hours it took to produce all the deluxe stereos is 1.2xy. Therefore, the total number of hours it took to produce all the stereos is:\n\n2xy + 1.2xy = 3.2xy\n\nThe number of hours it took to produce the deluxe stereos is 1.2xy, so the fraction of the total number of hours it took to produce all the stereos is:\n\n1.2xy / 3.2xy = 0.375 = {A)3/8}\n\nTherefore, the answer is A)3/8.",

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the midpoint of the chord PB.\nThe midpoint of a chord is also the center of the circle. We can find the midpoint by taking the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates:\nMidpoint = $({\\frac{-1+3}{2}},{\\frac{0+3}{2}})$ = $(1,1.5)$\n\nStep 2: Find the radius of the circle.\nThe distance from the center of the circle to either point P or B is the radius of the circle. We can use the distance formula to find the distance between the midpoint and either point:\n$PB = \\sqrt{(3-(-1))^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{16+9} = 5$\nSo the radius of the circle is 5.\n\nStep 3: Check that the area of the circle is (25/4) \u03c0.\nThe formula for the area of a circle is A = \u03c0r^2. Plugging in the radius we found in step 2, we get:\nA = \u03c0(5)^2 = 25\u03c0\nThis is not the same as (25/4) \u03c0, so we made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStep 4: Find the correct radius of the circle.\nWe made a mistake in step 2 because we used the distance between P and B as the diameter of the circle, but the chord PB is not necessarily a diameter. Instead, we need to find the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of PB, which is half the length of the chord. We can use the distance formula again:\n$PB = \\sqrt{(3-(-1))^2 + (3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{16+9} = 5$\nSo the length of the chord is 5, and half the length is 2.5. This is the radius of the circle.\n\nStep 5: Check that the area of the circle is (25/4) \u03c0.\nUsing the correct radius of 2.5, we can find the area of the circle:\nA = \u03c0(2.5)^2 = (25/4) \u03c0\nThis is the same as the given area, so we have the correct radius.\n\nStep 6: Find the coordinates of the center of the circle.\nWe already found the midpoint of PB in step 1, which is also the center of the circle.

The number of cubes in the figure is the product of these dimensions, which is 8x^3. Since there are 128 cubes in the figure, we have:\n8x^3 - 128 = 0\nSimplifying, we get:\nx^3 - 16 = 0\nFactoring, we get:\n(x-2)(x^2+2x+8) = 0\nThe quadratic factor has no real roots, so we must have x = 2. Therefore, the dimensions of the 128 cube figure are 2 x 4 x 4.\n\nStep 2: Find the dimensions of the foil covered prism.\nSince the 128 cube figure is not touching any tin foil on any of its sides, it must be completely surrounded by tin foil.

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the time it takes for them to meet\nWe know that they are 190 miles apart at 2:00 pm and are approaching each other. This means that their combined speed is 46 mph + 54 mph = 100 mph. To cover the 190 miles between them, they will take 190/100 = 1.9 hours or 1 hour and 54 minutes. \n\nStep 2: Find the time they are 35 miles apart\nSince they are moving away from each other, their combined speed is still 100 mph.

We can use the formula:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)\n\nwhere P(A \u2229 B) is the probability that both events A and B occur. We can rearrange this formula to solve for P(A \u2229 B):\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u222a B)\n\nNow we need to find P(A \u2229 B). We know that if a number less than 12 is drawn, then neither event A nor event B occurs. So:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(number \u2264 20) = P(number < 12) + P(12 \u2264 number \u2264 20)\n\nWe also know that if a number less than 12 is drawn, then event B does not occur. So:\n\nP(B) = P(number \u2265 12) = P(12 \u2264 number \u2264 20)\n\nPutting these together, we have:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(number < 12) + P(B) = 1 - P(number \u2265 12) + P(B) = 1 - P(A) + P(B)\n\nSubstituting into the formula for P(A \u2229 B), we get:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u222a B) = 1/5 + 2/3 - (1 - 1/5) = 3/5\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for P(A \u222a B) to get:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B) = 1/5 + 2/3 - 3/5 = {8/15}\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 8/15.",

            "Response": "The deposit is 10% of $24 000, which is $2 400. So the amount to be paid off over 60 months is $24 000 - $2 400 = $21 600.\n\nTo calculate the monthly installment, we need to use the formula:\n\nMonthly installment = Total amount to be paid / Number of months\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount to be paid. This includes the original amount of $21 600 plus the interest charged over the 60 months. To calculate the interest, we can use the formula:\n\nInterest = Principal x Rate x Time\n\nwhere Principal is the amount borrowed, Rate is the annual interest rate (12%), and Time is the time period in years (5 years, since there are 60 monthly payments in 5 years).\n\nSo the interest charged is:\n\nInterest = $21 600 x 0.12 x 5 = $12 960\n\nTherefore, the total amount to be paid is:\n\nTotal amount to be paid = $21 600 + $12 960 = $34 560\n\nNow we can calculate the monthly installment:\n\nMonthly installment = $34 560 / 60 = $576\n\nTherefore, the answer is {D) $576}.",

            "Response": "We can start by using the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nLet's first convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s:\n\n54 km/hr = (54 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 15 m/s\n\nNow, let's use this speed to find the length of the train. We know that the train passes the platform in 35 seconds, so:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = 15 m/s x 35 s\ndistance = 525 m\n\nSo, the length of the train is 525 meters.\n\nNext, let's use the fact that the man standing on the platform sees the train pass in 20 seconds. This means that he sees both the train and the platform passing by. We already know the length of the train, so we can use this information to find the length of the platform.\n\nLet's call the length of the platform \"x\". Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = (length of train + length of platform) x speed\ndistance = (525 + x) x 15\n\nWe also know that the man sees the train and the platform pass by in 20 seconds. This means that the distance he sees is the length of the train plus the length of the platform:\n\ndistance = length of train + length of platform\ndistance = 525 + x\n\nWe can set these two equations equal to each other, since they both represent the same distance:\n\n(525 + x) x 15 = 20(525 + x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n7875 + 15x = 10500 + 20x\n\nSubtracting 15x from both sides, we get:\n\n7875 = 10500 + 5x\n\nSubtracting 10500 from both sides, we get:\n\n-2625 = 5x\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nx = -525\n\nThis doesn't make sense as an answer, since the length of the platform can't be negative! So, we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe can see that we made a mistake in setting up the equation for the distance the man sees. We should have used the fact that he sees the train pass in 20 seconds, not the total time it takes for the train and platform to pass. So, the correct equation is:\n\ndistance = length of train + length of platform\ndistance = 525 + x\n\nWe can set this equal to the distance the train travels in 20 seconds:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = 15 m/s x 20 s\ndistance = 300 m\n\nSetting these two equations equal to each other, we get:\n\n525 + x = 300\n\nSubtracting 525 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = -225\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense as an answer. But this time, we can see that we made a mistake in assuming that the man sees the entire length of the platform. In reality, he only sees the part of the platform that is not covered by the train. So, the correct equation for the distance he sees is:\n\ndistance = length of platform - length of train\ndistance = x - 525\n\nSetting this equal to the distance the train travels in 20 seconds, we get:\n\nx - 525 = 300\n\nAdding 525 to both sides, we get:\n\nx = 825\n\nSo, the length of the platform is 825 meters. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {825}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the remainder when each of the given numbers is divided by some number N. Let that remainder be x. Then we have:\n\n1305 \u2261 x (mod N)\n4665 \u2261 x (mod N)\n6905 \u2261 x (mod N)\n\nTo find the value of N, we need to find the greatest common divisor of the three given numbers with the same remainder x. We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor of the differences between the numbers, since any common divisor of the differences will also be a common divisor of the original numbers. That is:\n\n4665 - 1305 = 3360\n6905 - 4665 = 2240\n6905 - 1305 = 5600\n\nSo we need to find the greatest common divisor of 3360, 2240, and 5600. We can simplify this by dividing each number by their greatest common divisor, which is 1120:\n\n3360 \u00f7 1120 = 3\n2240 \u00f7 1120 = 2\n5600 \u00f7 1120 = 5\n\nSo the greatest common divisor of the differences is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1120 = 33600. Therefore, N = 33600 \u00f7 x.\n\nTo find the sum of the digits in N, we need to add up the digits of 33600 and divide by x. We have:\n\n3 + 3 + 6 + 0 + 0 = 12\n\nSo the sum of the digits in N is 12 \u00f7 x. We don't know the value of x, but we can see that the only answer choice that is a factor of 12 is 6.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the position of the hour hand. At 5 o'clock, the hour hand is pointing directly at the 5 on the clock face. To find its position at 15 minutes past 5, we need to calculate how far it moves in 15 minutes. \n\nThere are 12 hours on a clock face, and 360 degrees in a circle. So, the hour hand moves 360/12 = 30 degrees per hour. In 15 minutes, it moves 30/4 = 7.5 degrees. \n\nSo, the hour hand is now pointing at the 5 and has moved an additional 7.5 degrees clockwise. \n\nNext, we need to find the position of the minute hand. At 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is pointing directly at the 3 on the clock face. \n\nTo find the angle between the hour and minute hands, we need to calculate the difference between their positions. \n\nThe hour hand has moved 7.5 degrees clockwise from the 5, which is equivalent to 360 - 7.5 = 352.5 degrees counterclockwise from the 12. \n\nThe minute hand is pointing directly at the 3, which is equivalent to 90 degrees counterclockwise from the 12. \n\nSo, the angle between the hour and minute hands is 352.5 - 90 = 262.5 degrees. \n\nHowever, we need to be careful with our answer format. The question asks for the angle at which the hands are inclined, which is half the angle between them. So, we divide 262.5 by 2 to get 131.25 degrees. \n\nFinally, we need to choose the closest answer option. The closest option is C) 135/2\u00b0, which is equivalent to 67.5 degrees. Our answer of 131.25 degrees is closer to this option than any of the other choices. \n\nTherefore, our final answer is {135/2\u00b0}.",

The cyclist travels the same distance plus some extra distance before stopping. We can use the formula distance = rate x time to find this distance.\n\ndistance = rate x time\ndistance = 0.4667 miles/minute x (5 minutes/60 minutes)  (since the cyclist stops after 5 minutes)\ndistance = 0.0389 miles\n\nSo the cyclist travels 0.0389 miles farther than the hiker before stopping.\n\nStep 3: Use the formula distance = rate x time again to find how long it takes the hiker to travel the distance the cyclist covered while waiting.\n\nNow we want to find how long it takes the hiker to travel the same distance the cyclist covered while waiting. We can use the same formula:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n0.0389 miles = 0.1167 miles/minute x time\ntime = 0.3333 minutes\n\nSo it takes the hiker 0.3333 minutes to cover the distance the cyclist covered while waiting.\n\nStep 4: Use the formula distance = rate x time one more time to find how long it takes the hiker to catch up to the cyclist.\n\nNow we want to find how long it takes the hiker to catch up to the cyclist. We know the distance the hiker needs to cover (d) and we know the combined rate of the hiker and cyclist (0.4667 + 0.1167 = 0.5834 miles per minute). We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = rate x time\nd = 0.5834 miles/minute x time\ntime = d / 0.5834\n\nSubstituting d = 0.0389 miles (the extra distance the cyclist covered while waiting), we get:\n\ntime = 0.0389 miles / 0.5834 miles/minute\ntime = 0.0667 minutes\n\nSo it takes the hiker 0.0667 minutes to catch up to the cyclist.\n\nStep 5: Convert the answer to minutes.\n\nThe answer is 0.0667 minutes, which is approximately 4 seconds. Converting to minutes, we get:\n\n0.0667 minutes = {1} minute (rounded to the nearest minute)\n\nTherefore, the cyclist must wait for the hiker for {1} minute. The answer is option A.",

            "Response": "Let's call the length and width of the photograph \"x\" and \"y\", respectively. \n\nThe area of the photograph is then xy. \n\nWhen we add a 1-inch border on each side, the length and width of the entire picture become (x+2) and (y+2), respectively. \n\nSo the total area becomes (x+2)(y+2) = xy + 2x + 2y + 4. \n\nWe're told that this total area is M. \n\nNow let's consider what happens when we add a 3-inch border on each side. \n\nThe length and width of the entire picture become (x+6) and (y+6), respectively. \n\nSo the total area becomes (x+6)(y+6) = xy + 6x + 6y + 36. \n\nWe're told that this total area is M+64. \n\nNow we can set up an equation: \n\nxy + 2x + 2y + 4 = M \n\nxy + 6x + 6y + 36 = M+64 \n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get: \n\n4x + 4y + 32 = 64 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nx + y + 8 = 16 \n\nx + y = 8 \n\nNow we can use this information to find the perimeter of the photograph. \n\nThe perimeter is simply 2x + 2y. \n\nSubstituting x+y=8, we get: \n\n2x + 2y = 2(x+y) = 2(8) = 16 \n\nSo the answer is {A)16}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to convert the speed of the man from km/hr to m/s. \n\n3 km/hr = (3 x 1000) m/3600 s = 5/6 m/s \n\nNext, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. \n\n63 km/hr = (63 x 1000) m/3600 s = 35/12 m/s \n\nNow, we can calculate the time taken by the train to cross the man. \n\nThe relative speed between the train and the man is the difference between their speeds. \n\n35/12 - 5/6 = 25/12 m/s \n\nThe distance to be covered is the length of the train, which is 500 m. \n\nTime = Distance/Speed = 500/(25/12) = 240 sec \n\nHowever, we need to subtract the time taken by the man to cover the distance of the length of the train. \n\nTime taken by the man = Distance/Speed = 500/5/6 = 600 sec \n\nTherefore, the actual time taken by the train to cross the man is: \n\n240 - 600 = -360 sec \n\nThis answer doesn't make sense because time cannot be negative. \n\nThe reason for this is that the man is walking in the same direction as the train, so the effective length of the train is reduced. \n\nThe effective length of the train = Actual length of the train - Distance covered by the train during the time taken by the train to cross the man. \n\nDistance covered by the train during the time taken by the train to cross the man = Speed x Time taken by the train to cross the man \n\n= (35/12) x 240 = 700 m \n\nEffective length of the train = 500 - 700 = -200 m \n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense because length cannot be negative. \n\nThe reason for this is that we made a mistake in assuming that the man is walking in the same direction as the train. \n\nIn fact, the man is walking in the opposite direction to the train. \n\nSo, the effective length of the train = Actual length of the train + Distance covered by the train during the time taken by the train to cross the man. \n\nDistance covered by the train during the time taken by the train to cross the man = Speed x Time taken by the train to cross the man \n\n= (35/12) x 240 = 700 m \n\nEffective length of the train = 500 + 700 = 1200 m \n\nNow, we can calculate the time taken by the train to cross the man. \n\nTime = Distance/Speed = 1200/(35/12) = 416.57 sec \n\nRounding off to the nearest second, we get: \n\nTime = 417 sec \n\nTherefore, the answer is {417}.",

For example, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (4.6 - 0.7y) / 0.5\n\nNow we can try different values of y and see if x is a whole number. If it is, then we have a solution. If not, we can try another value of y. We can also use the fact that x and y must be non-negative integers, since we can't have a fractional number of coins.\n\nUsing this method, we can find that y = 3 and x = 5 is a solution, since:\n\nx = (4.6 - 0.7y) / 0.5 = (4.6 - 0.7(3)) / 0.5 = 5\n\nSo the answer is {5,3}, or option E.",

We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the five cards among the three envelopes. We can use stars and bars to do this. We have 5 stars (representing the 5 cards) and 2 bars (representing the 3 envelopes). We can arrange them in $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ ways.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to find the product of the cards in each envelope. We can do this by finding the prime factorization of each envelope number. Each envelope number will have a product of 1, 2, or 3 primes. We can use casework to count the number of ways to get each product:\n\n- Product of 1 prime: There are 5 primes to choose from, so there are $3\\cdot 5=15$ ways to get a product of 1 prime (since we need to choose which envelope gets the product of 1 prime).\n- Product of 2 primes: There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose 2 primes, and then we need to choose which envelope gets the product of those 2 primes, so there are $3\\cdot 10=30$ ways to get a product of 2 primes.\n- Product of 3 primes: There are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose 3 primes, and then we need to choose which envelope gets the product of those 3 primes, so there are $3\\cdot 10=30$ ways to get a product of 3 primes.\n\nFinally, we need to count the number of ways to order the envelope numbers. There are 3! = 6 ways to do this.\n\nPutting it all together, the total number of K sets is $21\\cdot 15\\cdot 30\\cdot 30\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{510,300}$.",

            "Query": "A cylindrical bucket of height 36 cm and radius 21 cm is filled with sand. The bucket is emptied on the ground and a conical heap of sand is formed, the height of the heap being 12 cm. The radius of the heap at the base is :\nOptions:  A)63 cm B)53 cm C)56 cm D)66 cm E)None of these Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, we need to find the volume of sand in the cylindrical bucket. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nV = \u03c0(21)^2(36) = 49680\u03c0 cm^3\n\nNext, we need to find the volume of the conical heap of sand. The formula for the volume of a cone is V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. We know the height of the heap is 12 cm, but we don't know the radius yet. Let's call it x. Then, we have:\n\nV = (1/3)\u03c0x^2(12)\n\nWe also know that the volume of sand in the bucket is equal to the volume of sand in the heap, so we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:\n\n49680\u03c0 = (1/3)\u03c0x^2(12)\nx^2 = (49680*3)/(12*\u03c0)\nx^2 = 1242.857\nx \u2248 35.24\n\nSo the radius of the heap at the base is approximately 35.24 cm. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We need to round to the nearest whole number, which gives us 35 cm. But wait, that's still not one of the answer choices! We made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nAh, we forgot to add the height of the bucket to the height of the heap when calculating the total height of the sand. The total height is actually 36 + 12 = 48 cm. Let's redo the calculations with the correct height:\n\nV = \u03c0(21)^2(36) = 49680\u03c0 cm^3\n\nV = (1/3)\u03c0x^2(12)\n49680\u03c0 = (1/3)\u03c0x^2(12 + 36)\nx^2 = (49680*3)/(48*\u03c0)\nx^2 = 327.857\nx \u2248 18.1\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get x = 18 cm. But remember, the question is asking for the radius of the heap at the base, not the height. We need to use similar triangles to find the radius. The ratio of the radius of the heap to the height of the heap is the same as the ratio of the radius of the bucket to the height of the bucket. That is:\n\nr/12 = 21/36\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr = (12*21)/36 = 7\n\nSo the radius of the heap at the base is 7 times the height of the heap, which is 12 cm. Therefore, the radius of the heap at the base is:\n\nr = 7(12) = 84 cm\n\nBut wait, that's not one of the answer choices either! We made another mistake. We forgot to convert the radius from centimeters to meters. The correct answer is:\n\nr = 84/100 = 0.84 m\n\nTherefore, the answer is {None of these}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to calculate the total amount Louie will owe at the end of three months, including interest. To do this, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\nA = the total amount owed\nP = the principal (the amount borrowed)\nr = the interest rate (as a decimal)\nn = the number of times the interest is compounded per year\nt = the time period (in years)\n\nIn this case, P = $1000, r = 0.1 (10% per month), n = 12 (compounded monthly), and t = 0.25 (three months is a quarter of a year). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = 1000(1 + 0.1/12)^(12*0.25)\nA \u2248 $1331.02\n\nSo Louie will owe a total of $1331.02 at the end of three months.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the amount of each monthly payment.

To find the percentage, we multiply by 100 and get:\n\n1/9 x 100% = 11.11%\n\nTherefore, the answer is {11.11%}, which is closest to option B) 20%.",

            "Response": "In 1 minute, pipe A can fill 1/10 of the tank and pipe B can fill 1/20 of the tank. \n\nWhen both pipes are opened simultaneously, they can fill 1/10 + 1/20 = 3/20 of the tank in 1 minute. \n\nAfter 5 minutes, pipe A has filled 5/10 = 1/2 of the tank. So, the remaining part of the tank that needs to be filled is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. \n\nNow, only pipe B is filling the tank and it can fill 1/20 of the tank in 1 minute. \n\nTo fill 1/2 of the tank, pipe B will take (1/2)/(1/20) = 10 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the total time taken to fill the tank is 5 + 10 = 15 minutes. \n\nSo, the additional time taken by pipe B after pipe A is closed is 15 - 10 = 5 minutes. \n\nHence, the answer is {A)5min}.",

We can use the formula distance = speed x time. A's speed is 20 kmph and he has been traveling for 13 hours, so:\n\ndistance = 20 x 13 = 260 km\n\nNow we can set up an equation to find out when A and B will meet.

So the distance B has traveled is:\n\n25 x (t - 13)\n\nSetting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:\n\nd - 260 = 25(t - 13)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nd = 25t - 315\n\nWe also know that the total distance between Delhi and Mathura is 110 km, so:\n\nd + 260 = 110\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n25t - 315 + 260 = 110\n\n25t - 55 = 110\n\n25t = 165\n\nt = 6.6\n\nSo A and B will meet 6.6 hours after B starts, which is:\n\n8 p.m. + 6.6 hours = 2:36 a.m.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {2:36 a.m.}.",

This means that the number must be of the form:\n\n1657a + 6 = 2037b + 5\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1657a - 2037b = -1\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 1657 and 2037, which will help us solve this equation. \n\nFirst, we divide 2037 by 1657:\n\n2037 = 1657 x 1 + 380\n\nNext, we divide 1657 by 380:\n\n1657 = 380 x 4 + 117\n\nThen, we divide 380 by 117:\n\n380 = 117 x 3 + 29\n\nFinally, we divide 117 by 29:\n\n117 = 29 x 4 + 1\n\nSince we have reached a remainder of 1, we can stop the algorithm. The greatest common divisor of 1657 and 2037 is 1.\n\nNow, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a solution to the equation 1657a - 2037b = -1. \n\nStarting with the last two equations from the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n117 = 29 x 4 + 1\n\n29 = 380 - 117 x 3\n\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first:\n\n117 = (380 - 117 x 3) x 4 + 1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n117 x 13 = 380 x 4 - 1\n\nNow, we can use this solution to find a solution to the original equation 1657a - 2037b = -1. Multiplying both sides by 13, we get:\n\n15241a - 26481b = -13\n\nWe can see that a solution to this equation is a = -2 and b = -1. \n\nTherefore, the number we are looking for is:\n\n1657 x (-2) + 6 = -3308 + 6 = -3302\n\nHowever, we are looking for the greatest number that satisfies the given conditions, so we need to add the product of 1657 and 2037 to this number until we get a positive result:\n\n-3302 + 1657 x 2037 = 3375729\n\nTherefore, the greatest number that leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 1657 and a remainder of 5 when divided by 2037 is {274}.",

The distance of the second half is also 20 miles. We know that the second half took 8 hours longer than the first half, so:\n\ntime = 20 / (x/2) + 8\ntime = 40 / x + 8\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation and solve for x.\nThe total time it took the runner to run the entire 40 miles is the sum of the time it took for the first half and the time it took for the second half:\n\ntotal time = 20/x + 40/x + 8\n\nWe also know that the total time is equal to the distance divided by the average speed:\n\ntotal time = 40 / ((20/x) + (20/(x/2)))\n\nSetting these two equations equal to each other, we get:\n\n40 / ((20/x) + (20/(x/2))) = 20/x + 40/x + 8\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n40 / ((40/x) + (40/x)) = 60/x + 8\n40x / 80 = 60 + 8x\n32x = 240\nx = 7.5\n\nStep 4: Find the time it took the runner to run the second half.\nNow that we know the runner's constant speed before the injury is 7.5 mph, we can use the equation we set up in Step 2 to find the time it took the runner to run the second half:\n\ntime = 40 / x + 8\ntime = 40 / 7.5 + 8\ntime = 16\n\nTherefore, the answer is {16}.",
