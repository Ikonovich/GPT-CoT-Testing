            "Response": "-51. \n\nTo solve this expression, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): \n\n1. First, we perform any calculations inside parentheses, but there are none in this expression. \n\n2. Next, we evaluate any exponents, but there are none in this expression. \n\n3. Moving left to right, we perform any multiplication or division. In this case, we have 9 * 5, which equals 45. \n\n4. Continuing left to right, we perform any addition or subtraction. In this case, we have 8 - 8 + 4 - 45 - 2. \n\n5. We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: 8 - 8 is 0, so we can eliminate those terms. 4 - 2 is 2. \n\n6. Our expression now simplifies to: 0 + 2 - 45 = -43. \n\nTherefore, the answer is -51.",
