If we assume that each book costs the same amount, then Adam would have earned enough money to buy 11 new books (since he sold 11 books). \n\nSo now we can add those 11 new books to the 22 books he had left: \n\n22 + 11 = 33 \n\nThis tells us that after selling 11 books and using the money to buy new ones, Adam would have 33 books again. \n\nBut wait! The question asks how many books Adam would have if he bought 23 new books, not 11. So we need to adjust our answer. \n\nSince we know that Adam had 22 books left after selling 11, we can assume that he used some of his own money (in addition to the money he earned from selling the books) to buy the extra 12 books he needed to reach 23. \n\nSo now we can add those 23 new books to the 22 books he had left: \n\n22 + 23 = 45 \n\nThis tells us that if Adam sold 11 books and used the money to buy 23 new ones, he would end up with 45 books in total.",

If we assume that each book costs the same amount, then Adam would have earned enough money to buy 19 new books. \n\nSo now we can add the 19 new books he bought to the 29 books he had left: \n\n29 + 19 = 48 \n\nThis gives us a total of 48 books, which is the same as Adam's original number of books. But wait, we're not done yet! The problem asks how many books Adam would have after buying the new books, so we need to add those to the total as well: \n\n48 + 38 = 86 \n\nSo the final answer is 86 books.",

            "Response": "4 pages. \n\nTo see why, we can start by figuring out how many cards Oliver has in total: \n\n- He starts with some number of cards (let's call it x). \n- He adds 2 new cards. \n- He adds 10 old cards. \n\nSo in total, he has x + 2 + 10 = x + 12 cards. \n\nNow we need to figure out how many pages that will take up. Since there are 3 cards per page, we can divide the total number of cards by 3 to get the number of pages: \n\n- (x + 12) / 3 \n\nBut we don't know what x is, so we can't simplify this expression any further. However, we do know that the answer has to be a whole number (since you can't have a fraction of a page). So we need to find a value of x that makes the expression a whole number. \n\nWe can start by trying some values of x: \n\n- If x = 0, then (x + 12) / 3 = 4, so he would need 4 pages. \n- If x = 1, then (x + 12) / 3 = 4.33, which isn't a whole number. \n- If x = 2, then (x + 12) / 3 = 4.67, which isn't a whole number. \n- If x = 3, then (x + 12) / 3 = 5, so he would need 5 pages. \n\nSo it looks like the answer is either 4 or 5 pages, depending on how many cards Oliver started with. But since the problem doesn't give us any information about that, we can't say for sure which answer is correct. We can only say that he will need at least 4 pages, and possibly 5.",

            "Response": "18 problems per page. \n\nTo find this, you can start by subtracting the number of problems Nancy finished from the total number of problems: \n\n101 - 47 = 54 \n\nThis tells us that Nancy still had 54 problems left to do. Since she had 6 pages of problems left, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of pages: \n\n54 \u00f7 6 = 9 \n\nSo each page has 9 problems on it. However, the question asks for the number of problems on each page, not the number of pages. To find this, we can divide the total number of problems by the number of pages: \n\n47 + 54 = 101 \n\n101 \u00f7 6 = 16.83 \n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a problem, we can round up to the nearest whole number: \n\n17 problems per page \n\nBut wait! We made a mistake earlier when we assumed that Nancy had 54 problems left after finishing 47. We forgot to account for the 6 pages of problems she still had to do. Each of those pages must have had one extra problem on it: \n\n54 + 6 = 60 \n\nSo Nancy actually had 60 problems left to do. Dividing this by the number of pages gives us: \n\n60 \u00f7 6 = 10 \n\nSo each page has 10 problems on it. But wait again! We forgot to include the 47 problems Nancy already finished. Adding those in gives us: \n\n47 + 60 = 107 \n\nNow we have more problems than we started with! What went wrong? \n\nThe problem is that we assumed that each page had the same number of problems on it, but that might not be true. We know that Nancy finished 47 problems in total, and we know that she had 6 pages of problems left. If we assume that each of those pages had the same number of problems on it, we can set up an equation: \n\n47 = x * 6 \n\nwhere x is the number of problems on each page. Solving for x gives us: \n\nx = 7.83 \n\nAgain, we can't have a fraction of a problem, so we'll round up to the nearest whole number: \n\n8 problems per page \n\nNow we can check if this works. If each page has 8 problems on it, then Nancy had 8 * 6 = 48 problems left to do. Subtracting the 47 problems she already finished gives us: \n\n48 - 47 = 1 \n\nSo Nancy had one page left to do, and that page had 8 problems on it. This matches the information we were given, so we can be confident that the answer is 8 problems per page.",
