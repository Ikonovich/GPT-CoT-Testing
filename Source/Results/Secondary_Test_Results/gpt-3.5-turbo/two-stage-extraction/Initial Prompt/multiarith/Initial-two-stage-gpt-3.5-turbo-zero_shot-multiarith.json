Divide the number of puppies left by the maximum number of puppies that can fit in each cage to find the minimum number of cages needed: 40 \u00f7 8 = 5.\n3. Since the number of cages must be a whole number, round up the result to the nearest integer: 5 rounds up to 5.\n4. Therefore, the pet store used 5 cages for the remaining puppies.\n\nAlternatively, one could also use multiplication and subtraction to check the answer. If there were 5 cages with 8 puppies each, that would account for 5 x 8 = 40 puppies. Since there were originally 81 puppies and 41 were sold, that leaves 81 - 41 - 40 = 0 puppies unaccounted for, which confirms that all the puppies were either sold or put into cages.",

            "Response": "There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use algebra. Let's assume that there are x players on Bianca's team (excluding Bianca herself). Then we can write an equation based on the given information:\n\n45 + 6(x-1) = 75\n\nThe left-hand side represents the total points scored by the team, with 45 being Bianca's contribution and 6(x-1) being the sum of the other players' scores (since each of them scored 6 points). The right-hand side is the total score of the game, which we know is 75.\n\nNow we can solve for x by simplifying and isolating the variable:\n\n45 + 6x - 6 = 75\n6x = 75 - 45 + 6\n6x = 36\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, there were 6 players on Bianca's team (excluding Bianca herself). We can check that this answer makes sense by verifying that the total points add up to 75:\n\n45 + 6(6-1) = 75\n45 + 30 = 75\n75 = 75\n\nSo the answer is consistent with the given information.",
