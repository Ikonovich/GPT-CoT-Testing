            "Response": "First, we need to find the total number of meals that were ordered. Since there were 2 adults and 5 children, we can add them together to get a total of 7 people. \n\nNext, we need to multiply the total number of people by the number of meals each person ordered. Since we don't know how many meals each person ordered, we can assume that everyone ordered one meal. Therefore, we can multiply 7 by 1 to get a total of 7 meals. \n\nFinally, we can multiply the total number of meals by the cost per meal, which is $8. So, 7 meals x $8 per meal = $56. \n\nTherefore, the bill for the group with 2 adults and 5 children at Tom's Restaurant would be $56.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find out how much money Mike had left after buying the new mower blades. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made:\n\n69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars\n\nSo Mike had 45 dollars left after buying the new mower blades. \n\nNext, we need to figure out how many 5 dollar games he could buy with that money. We can do this by dividing the amount of money he had left by the cost of each game:\n\n45 dollars \u00f7 5 dollars/game = 9 games\n\nTherefore, Mike could buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he had left after buying the new mower blades.",
