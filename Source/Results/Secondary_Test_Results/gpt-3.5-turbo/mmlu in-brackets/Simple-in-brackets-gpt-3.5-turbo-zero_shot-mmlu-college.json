            "Query": "A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed? Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n ",
            "Response": "Let's first find out how much salt is being added to the tank per minute. The sprayed solution contains 0.02 grams of salt per liter, and 4 liters are being added per minute, so:\n\n0.02 grams/L x 4 L/min = 0.08 grams/min\n\nNow let's find out how much salt is being removed from the tank per minute. The mixture is flowing out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute, and the concentration of salt in the mixture is the same as the concentration of salt in the tank. We can use the initial concentration of 3 grams of salt per 100 liters of water to find the concentration of salt in the tank:\n\n3 grams/100 L = 0.03 grams/L\n\nSo, 4 liters of mixture are flowing out of the tank per minute, and each liter contains 0.03 grams of salt, so:\n\n4 L/min x 0.03 grams/L = 0.12 grams/min\n\nSince the rate of salt being removed from the tank (0.12 grams/min) is greater than the rate of salt being added to the tank (0.08 grams/min), the amount of salt in the tank will decrease over time. We can use the following formula to find the amount of salt in the tank after t minutes:\n\namount of salt = initial amount of salt - (rate of salt being removed - rate of salt being added) x t\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n\namount of salt = 3 grams - (0.12 grams/min - 0.08 grams/min) x 100 min\namount of salt = 3 grams - 0.04 grams/min x 100 min\namount of salt = 3 grams - 4 grams\namount of salt = -1 gram\n\nUh oh, we ended up with a negative amount of salt! This means that the concentration of salt in the tank has dropped below 0.02 grams per liter, and the sprayed solution is actually diluting the salt solution in the tank. We can use the following formula to find out how long it takes for the concentration of salt in the tank to drop to 0.02 grams per liter:\n\n0.02 grams/L = 3 grams/100 L x (100 L - 4t)/100 L + 0.02 grams/L x 4t/100 L\n\nSimplifying:\n\n0.02 = 0.03 - 0.0004t + 0.0008t\n0.0004t = 0.01\nt = 25\n\nSo it takes 25 minutes for the concentration of salt in the tank to drop to 0.02 grams per liter. After that, the amount of salt in the tank will be:\n\namount of salt = 3 grams - (0.12 grams/min - 0.08 grams/min) x 25 min - 0.02 grams/min x 75 min\namount of salt = 3 grams - 0.04 grams/min x 25 min - 1.5 grams\namount of salt = 1.5 grams\n\nTherefore, the final answer is {1.5}.",

            "Response": "We can use the property of f(1 + x) = f(x) to simplify the problem. Let's substitute x = 4/2 in f(1 + x) = f(x) to get:\n\nf(1 + 4/2) = f(4/2)\nf(3) = f(2)\n\nSimilarly, we can substitute x = 2/2 in f(1 + x) = f(x) to get:\n\nf(1 + 2/2) = f(2/2)\nf(2) = f(1)\n\nNow, we can use these equations to find f(15/2) as follows:\n\nf(15/2) = f(1 + 7/2) = f(7/2)\n= f(1 + 5/2) = f(5/2)\n= f(1 + 3/2) = f(3/2)\n= f(1 + 1/2) = f(1/2)\n= f(1 + (-1/2)) = f(-1/2)\n= f(1 + (-3/2)) = f(-3/2)\n= f(1 + (-5/2)) = f(-5/2)\n= f(1 + (-7/2)) = f(-7/2)\n\nNotice that we have used the property of f(1 + x) = f(x) repeatedly to simplify the argument of f. Also, since f is a polynomial, it is continuous, so we can use the intermediate value theorem to conclude that f(15/2) = f(-7/2). Therefore:\n\nf(15/2) = f(-7/2)\n\nNow, we can use the given information that f(5) = 11 to find the value of f(-7/2) as follows:\n\nf(5) = 11\nf(1 + 4) = 11\nf(4) = 11\n\nSimilarly, we can use f(1 + 3) = f(2) to get:\n\nf(3) = f(2)\nf(1 + 2) = f(1)\nf(2) = f(1)\n\nAnd f(1 + 2) = f(1) to get:\n\nf(2) = f(1)\nf(1 + 1) = f(1/2)\nf(1) = f(1/2)\n\nFinally, we can use f(1 + 1/2) = f(-1/2) to get:\n\nf(1/2) = f(-1/2)\nf(1 + (-1/2)) = f(-7/2)\nf(-1/2) = f(-7/2)\n\nTherefore, f(15/2) = f(-7/2) = f(-1/2) = f(1/2) = f(1) = f(2) = f(3) = f(4) = 11. \n\nHence, f(15/2) = {11}.",

As $x$ approaches $-\\infty$, $e^x$ goes to 0 much faster than $x$ goes to $-\\infty$, so $f(x)$ approaches $-2$. As $x$ approaches $\\infty$, $e^x$ grows much faster than $x$, so $f(x)$ grows without bound.

To do this, we'll need to take the derivative of both sides of the equation above with respect to time:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ndy/dt = -x/y * dx/dt\n\nNow we just need to plug in the values we know:\n\nx = ?

Then the length of the third segment is $10-x-y$. In order for these three segments to form a triangle, each segment must be shorter than the sum of the other two segments. This can be expressed as the following inequalities:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &< y + (10-x-y) \\\\\ny &< x + (10-x-y) \\\\\n10-x-y &< x + y\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying these inequalities, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &< 5 \\\\\ny &< 5 \\\\\nx+y &> 5\n\\end{align*}\n\nGraphing these inequalities on the coordinate plane, we get:\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,10));\ndraw((5,0)--(0,5));\ndraw((5,0)--(5,5));\ndraw((0,5)--(10,5));\ndraw((0,6)--(10,6),dashed);\ndraw((0,4)--(10,4),dashed);\ndraw((6,0)--(6,10),dashed);\ndraw((4,0)--(4,10),dashed);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (5,-1), S);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (-1,5), W);\nlabel(\"$10-x-y$\", (5,6), NE);\nlabel(\"$5$\", (5,4), S);\nlabel(\"$5$\", (4,5), W);\nlabel(\"$5$\", (6,5), E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe shaded region represents the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the inequalities and therefore form valid segments for a triangle.

Then T has two eigenvectors, [1 0; 0 0] and [0 0; 0 1], but it can be shown that not all matrices in M(V) commute with T. Therefore, U is not equal to M(V).\n\nTo prove statement II, we will show that U and W are complementary subspaces of M(V), meaning that M(V) is the direct sum of U and W. To do this, we will show that every matrix in M(V) can be uniquely decomposed as a sum of a matrix in U and a matrix in W.\n\nFirst, let's show that U and W are indeed subspaces of M(V). It is easy to see that the zero matrix is in both U and W. To show that U is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, suppose X and Y are matrices in U and a and b are scalars. Then we have:\n\nT(aX + bY) = aTX + bTY = aXT + bYT = (aX + bY)T\n\nTherefore, aX + bY is also in U. To show that W is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, suppose X and Y are matrices in M(V) and a and b are scalars. Then we have:\n\nT(aX + bY) - (aX + bY)T = a(TX - XT) + b(TY - YT)\n\nTherefore, aX + bY is also in W.\n\nNext, let's show that every matrix in M(V) can be decomposed as a sum of a matrix in U and a matrix in W. Given a matrix A in M(V), define B = (A + AT)/2 and C = (A - AT)/2. Then we have:\n\nB = (A + AT)/2 \u2208 U\n\nC = (A - AT)/2 \u2208 W\n\nA = B + C\n\nTo see why this works, note that B is the symmetric part of A (i.e. the part that commutes with T), and C is the skew-symmetric part of A (i.e. the part that anticommutes with T). Therefore, every matrix in M(V) can be uniquely decomposed as a sum of a matrix in U and a matrix in W, and so M(V) is the direct sum of U and W. This implies that dim(U) + dim(W) = dim(M(V)) = n^2.\n\nFinally, to see why statement III is not necessarily true, consider the following example: let V be the vector space of 2x2 matrices, and let T be the matrix [0 1; -1 0]. Then it can be shown that U is the set of matrices of the form [a b; -b a], which has dimension 2, so dim(U) = 2 < n. Therefore, statement III is false.\n\nIn summary, the only statement that is true is II, so our final answer is {II}.",

This is equivalent to finding the number of times $k!$ is divisible by $10^{99}$, which is the same as finding the number of times $k!$ is divisible by $2^{99}$ and $5^{99}$.\n\nBy Legendre's Formula, the highest power of $p$ that divides $n!$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.

Then we want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $a \\ge 99$ and $b \\ge 99$.\n\nNote that $a = \\frac{k - 2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 k \\rfloor + 1}}{1 - 2}$ and $b = \\frac{k - 5^{\\lfloor \\log_5 k \\rfloor + 1}}{1 - 5}$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $k$ such that $k!$ ends in exactly $99$ zeros is the number of integers between $2^{98} + 99$ and $5^{98} + 396$ inclusive, which is $\\boxed{406}$.",

            "Response": "We claim that only (II) must be true.\n\nFirst, note that the set {0} is always a right ideal of any ring R, so if R has exactly two right ideals, then the other right ideal must be a proper non-zero subset of R.\n\nNow, suppose U is a non-zero right ideal of R. Since U is an additive subgroup of R, it contains the additive identity 0. Let u be any non-zero element of U. Then, by the definition of a right ideal, we have uR = {ur : r in R} is a subset of U. In particular, this means that u is a right divisor of every element of U.\n\nIf R is commutative, then every left ideal is also a right ideal, and so U is a left ideal as well. Thus, U is an ideal, and since it is non-zero and proper, it must be the whole ring R.

In particular, we can rearrange the terms so that all the positive terms come first, followed by all the negative terms. This rearrangement will not change the sum of the series, but it will make it clear that the sum is equal to 2.

Therefore, there must be at least one acute angle. \n\nLet $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{10}$ be the measures of the angles in the 10-gon. We want to maximize the number of acute angles, which means we want to minimize the number of angles that are at least $90^\\circ$. Let $n$ be the number of angles that are at least $90^\\circ$. Then the sum of the angles is $a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{10} \\geq (10-n) \\cdot 90^\\circ + n \\cdot 180^\\circ$. \n\nSetting this expression equal to $1440^\\circ$, we get $(10-n) \\cdot 90^\\circ + n \\cdot 180^\\circ = 1440^\\circ$, which simplifies to $n = 4$. Therefore, there are at most $10-4 = 6$ acute angles. \n\nTo see that it is possible to have 6 acute angles, consider a regular decagon.
