Now that there are two equations with only one variable, x, they can be solved by setting them equal to each other and solving for x. 10x + y = -8 and 8x = 3 can be rewritten as 10x = -8 and 8x = 3. 10x = -8 can be rewritten as 10x + 8 = 0 and solved for x by adding 8 to each side and then dividing each side by 10.
