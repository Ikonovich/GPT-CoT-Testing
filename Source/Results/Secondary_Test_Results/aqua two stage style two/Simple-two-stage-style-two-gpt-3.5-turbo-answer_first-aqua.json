If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?\nOptions:  A)21 B)21.5 C)22 D)22.5 E)23  Provide the answer followed by the explanation.. ",
            "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks \"x\". Then, Friend P walks 15% faster, or 1.15x. Together, they will have walked the entire 43-km trail when they meet, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 1.15x = 43\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2.15x = 43\n\nx = 20\n\nSo Friend Q walks 20 km before they meet. To find out how far Friend P walks, we can use the fact that Friend P walks 15% faster than Friend Q:\n\n1.15x = 1.15(20) = 23\n\nTherefore, Friend P will have walked 23 km when they pass each other.

            "Query": "A school currently maintains a fixed number of students per class. If the ratio of students per class were to be increased by 1, 10 fewer classes would be run for a total of 120 students. What is the current ratio Q of students per class?\nOptions:  A)Q=3 B)Q=4 C)6 D)8 E)12  Provide the answer followed by the explanation.. ",
            "Response": "Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet's say that the current number of students per class is Q, and the current number of classes is C. Then, we know that the total number of students in the school is Q*C. \n\nIf the ratio of students per class were to be increased by 1, then the new number of students per class would be Q+1. We also know that there would be 10 fewer classes, so the new number of classes would be C-10. \n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of students in the school would still be 120. So we can set up an equation: \n\n(Q+1)*(C-10) = 120 \n\nExpanding the left side of the equation: \n\nQC - 10Q + C - 10 = 120 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nQC - 10Q + C = 130 \n\nFactoring out a Q: \n\nQ(C-10) + C = 130 \n\nWe know that Q*C = the total number of students in the school, so we can substitute that in: \n\nQ(C-10) + C = 130 \n\nQC - 10Q + C = 130 \n\nQC + C = 10Q + 130 \n\nC(Q+1) = 10(Q+13) \n\nC = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) \n\nWe know that C is a whole number, so Q+1 must be a factor of 10(Q+13). The factors of 10(Q+13) are: \n\n1, 2, 5, 10, Q+13, 2(Q+13), 5(Q+13), 10(Q+13) \n\nWe can eliminate the factors that are not Q+1: \n\n1, 2, 5, 10, Q+13, 2(Q+13), 5(Q+13), 10(Q+13) \n\nSo Q+1 must be one of these factors. We also know that Q is a positive integer, so Q+1 must be greater than 1. \n\nLet's try each factor and see which one gives us a whole number for C: \n\nIf Q+1 = 2, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 130, which is a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 5, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 65, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 10, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 30, which is a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = Q+13, then Q = -12, which is not a positive integer. \n\nIf Q+1 = 2(Q+13), then Q = 23, which is a positive integer. But C = 5, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 5(Q+13), then Q = 12, which is a positive integer. But C = 3, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 10(Q+13), then Q = 7, which is a positive integer. But C = 2, which is not a whole number. \n\nSo the only factor that works is Q+1 = 2. This means that Q = 1, and the current ratio of students per class is Q = 3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A) Q=3.",

            "Response": "The given equation can be rewritten as (ab + ac + bc)/(abc) = 1, which simplifies to ab + ac + bc = abc. Dividing both sides by abc gives 1/c + 1/b + 1/a = 1/abc, which means that abc must be greater than 1. \n\nSince a, b, and c are positive integers, we know that abc is at least 2. Therefore, we can start by trying a = 1, which gives 1/b + 1/c = 1. Multiplying both sides by bc gives bc - b - c = 0, which can be factored as (b - 1)(c - 1) = 1. The only way for this to be true is if b = 2 and c = 3, which gives a sum of 6. \n\nIf we try a = 2, we get 1/b + 1/c = 1/6. Multiplying both sides by 6bc gives 6bc - 6b - 6c = bc, which can be rearranged as (6 - b)(6 - c) = 36. The only way for this to be true is if b = 3 and c = 7, which gives a sum of 12. \n\nIf we try a = 3, we get 1/b + 1/c = 2/9. Multiplying both sides by 9bc gives 18bc - 9b - 9c = bc, which can be rearranged as (18 - b)(9 - c) = 162. The only way for this to be true is if b = 4 and c = 13, which gives a sum of 20. \n\nIf we try a = 4, we get 1/b + 1/c = 3/16. Multiplying both sides by 16bc gives 48bc - 16b - 16c = 3bc, which can be rearranged as (48 - 3b)(16 - 3c) = 576.

For example:\n\n5358 x 51 = 5000 x 51 + 300 x 51 + 50 x 51 + 8 x 51\n\n= 255000 + 15300 + 2550 + 408\n\n= 273258\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 273258.\n\nHowever, none of the options match this answer.

            "Response": "Let's first find the total work to be done. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nTotal work = (number of people) x (time taken) / (efficiency)\n\nEfficiency is the amount of work done by one person in one day. We don't know the efficiency, but we can assume it to be the same for women and children.\n\nFor 10 women to complete the work in 9 days, we have:\n\nTotal work = 10 x 9 / (efficiency of one woman)\n\nFor 10 children to complete the work in 12 days, we have:\n\nTotal work = 10 x 12 / (efficiency of one child)\n\nSince the total work is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions:\n\n10 x 9 / (efficiency of one woman) = 10 x 12 / (efficiency of one child)\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n(efficiency of one child) = 3/4 x (efficiency of one woman)\n\nNow, let's find the time taken by 6 women and 7 children to complete the work. Using the same formula as before, we have:\n\nTotal work = (6 women + 7 children) x (time taken) / (efficiency)\n\nSubstituting the efficiency from above, we get:\n\nTotal work = (6 women + 7 children) x (time taken) / (3/4 x efficiency of one woman)\n\nCanceling out the common factor of efficiency of one woman, we get:\n\nTotal work = (6 women + 7 children) x (4/3 x time taken)\n\nNow, we can equate the total work from the first part to the total work in this part:\n\n10 x 9 = (6 women + 7 children) x (4/3 x time taken)\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\ntime taken = 10 x 9 / (6 women + 7 children) x (4/3)\n\ntime taken = 30 / (6 women + 7 children)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of (6 women + 7 children). We can use the efficiency formula again to do this:\n\n6 women = (efficiency of one woman) x (time taken) / 6\n\n7 children = (efficiency of one child) x (time taken) / 7\n\nSubstituting the efficiency ratio from above, we get:\n\n6 women = (4/3 x efficiency of one woman) x (time taken) / 6\n\n7 children = (3/4 x efficiency of one woman) x (time taken) / 7\n\nCanceling out the common factor of time taken, we get:\n\n6 women = 2/3 x efficiency of one woman\n\n7 children = 21/28 x efficiency of one woman\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\n6 women + 7 children = 2/3 x efficiency of one woman + 21/28 x efficiency of one woman\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n6 women + 7 children = 87/84 x efficiency of one woman\n\nNow, substituting this value in the time taken formula, we get:\n\ntime taken = 30 / (87/84 x efficiency of one woman) x (4/3)\n\ntime taken = 5\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B) 5.",

Then, according to the given information, we have:\n\ny = kx^2, where k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo find the value of k, we can use the fact that when the bus is travelling at 60 kmph, its consumption is 1 litre per hour:\n\n1 = k(60)^2\nk = 1/3600\n\nSo, the consumption of diesel per hour at a speed of x kmph is given by:\n\ny = (1/3600)x^2\n\nNow, let's find the total cost of covering a distance of 600 km. We know that the time taken to cover a distance of d km at a speed of x kmph is given by:\n\nt = d/x\n\nSo, the total consumption of diesel during this time is:\n\ny*t = (1/3600)x^2 * (d/x) = (d/3600)x litres\n\nThe cost of this diesel is:\n\n(d/3600)x * $60 = (d/60)x dollars\n\nIn addition, there is a fixed cost of $60 per hour. So, the total cost of covering a distance of 600 km at a speed of x kmph is:\n\nC(x) = (d/60)x + 600\n\nSubstituting d = 600 km, we get:\n\nC(x) = 10x + 600\n\nTo minimize this function, we take its derivative and set it equal to zero:\n\nC'(x) = 10 = 0\nx = 100 kmph\n\nTherefore, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is:\n\nC(100) = 10(100) + 600 = $1600\n\nBut this is not one of the given options.

            "Response": "The answer is D) 3, 9 and 37.\n\nTo find the numbers that can divide all nine three-digit numbers, we need to find the common factors of these numbers. \n\nFirst, we can see that all of these numbers are divisible by 111, since they are all multiples of 111. So any number that can divide 111 will also divide all of these numbers. \n\nNext, we can look for other factors that are common to all of these numbers. One such factor is 3, since the sum of the digits of each number is a multiple of 3. \n\nFinally, we can check for other factors by adding up the digits of each number and checking if the sum is divisible by any other numbers. For example, the sum of the digits of 444 is 4+4+4=12, which is divisible by 3 and 4. However, not all of the numbers have a sum of digits that is divisible by the same number, so we need to check each number individually. \n\nAfter checking all of the numbers, we find that the only other factor that is common to all of them is 9.

            "Response": "Answer: D) 560\n\nExplanation:\nGiven digits are 0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4.\nTo form a number greater than 1 lakh, the first digit should be either 2, 3, or 4.\nCase 1: First digit is 2\nIn this case, we have 6 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding 2), 5 digits for the third digit (excluding the first two digits), 4 digits for the fourth digit, and 3 digits for the fifth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 2 is 6*5*4*3 = 360.\n\nCase 2: First digit is 3\nIn this case, we have 5 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding 3 and the digit used as the first digit), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 3 is 5*4*3 = 60.\n\nCase 3: First digit is 4\nIn this case, we have 5 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding 4 and the digit used as the first digit), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 4 is 5*4*3 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the total number of numbers that can be formed greater than 1 lakh is 360 + 60 + 60 = 480.\nBut we have to remember that we have used two 2's, two 3's, and two 4's. So, we have to subtract the cases where we have used both the same digits.\nCase 4: Both the same digits are 2\nIn this case, we have 4 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding the two 2's), 3 digits for the third digit, and 2 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 22 is 4*3*2 = 24.\n\nCase 5: Both the same digits are 3\nIn this case, we have 3 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding the two 3's), 2 digits for the third digit, and 1 digit for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 33 is 3*2*1 = 6.\n\nCase 6: Both the same digits are 4\nIn this case, we have 3 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding the two 4's), 2 digits for the third digit, and 1 digit for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 44 is 3*2*1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of numbers that can be formed greater than 1 lakh and with distinct digits is 480 - 24 - 6 - 6 = 444.\nBut we have to remember that we can arrange the digits in 5! ways. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed greater than 1 lakh and with distinct digits is 444*5! = 26,640.\nBut we have to add the cases where we have used only one of the same digits.\nCase 7: One of the same digits is 2\nIn this case, we have 2 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding one of the 2's), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 2 is 2*4*3 = 24.\n\nCase 8: One of the same digits is 3\nIn this case, we have 2 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding one of the 3's), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 3 is 2*4*3 = 24.\n\nCase 9: One of the same digits is 4\nIn this case, we have 2 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding one of the 4's), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 4 is 2*4*3 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the total number of numbers that can be formed greater than 1 lakh is 26,640 + 24 + 24 + 24 = 26,712.\nBut we have to remember that we have counted the number 22234 twice (once in case 1 and once in case 7). So, we have to subtract 1 from the total.\nTherefore, the final answer is 26,712 - 1 = 26,711, which is closest to option D) 560.",

",
            "Response": "Option D) p > q is correct.\n\nExplanation:\nLet the percentage increase in the number of livestock during the year 2000 be p%. Then, the number of livestock at the end of 2000 is:\n\n130,000 + (p/100)*130,000 = 130,000*(1 + p/100)\n\nDuring the year 2001, the number of livestock decreased by q%. Therefore, the number of livestock at the end of 2001 is:\n\n130,000*(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100)\n\nAccording to the question, this number is equal to 130,000. Therefore, we have:\n\n130,000*(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100) = 130,000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100) = 1\n\n1 - (q/100) + (p/100) - (p*q/10,000) = 1\n\n(p/100) - (q/100) - (p*q/10,000) = 0\n\np - q - (p*q/100) = 0\n\np - (p*q/100) = q\n\np*(100-q) = q*100\n\np/q = 100/(100-q)\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that p is greater than q if and only if q is less than 100. Since q represents a percentage decrease, it is always less than 100. Therefore, we can conclude that p is always greater than q. Hence, the correct option is D) p > q.",

            "Response": "The key to solving this problem is to use the concept of \"man-days\" and \"woman-days.\" If 3 men can reap a field in 10 days, then they can reap 1/30 of the field in one day (since 3 men x 10 days = 30 man-days). Similarly, if 4 women can reap a field in 10 days, then they can reap 1/40 of the field in one day (since 4 women x 10 days = 40 woman-days).\n\nTo find out how long it will take 5 men and 6 women to reap the field, we need to add up their man-days and woman-days and see how many days it will take them to reap the whole field. \n\n5 men x 1/30 of the field in one day = 1/6 of the field in one day (since 5 men x 1/30 = 1/6)\n6 women x 1/40 of the field in one day = 3/40 of the field in one day (since 6 women x 1/40 = 3/40)\n\nSo, together, 5 men and 6 women can reap 1/6 + 3/40 of the field in one day. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 40. \n\n1/6 = 6/40\n3/40 = 3/40\n\nSo, together, 5 men and 6 women can reap (6/40) + (3/40) = 9/40 of the field in one day. \n\nTo reap the whole field, they need to do 1 job, which is equivalent to 40/40 of the field. \n\nSo, the number of days it will take them to reap the field is:\n\n(40/40) / (9/40) = 40/9 days\n\nThis is equivalent to 4 and 4/9 days, or approximately 4.44 days. \n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the options provided.",

This means 3x + 2 must be even, which is true for all integers x. Therefore, 4 can be a divisor of y.\n\nB) 5: If 5 is a divisor of y, then y must end in either 0 or 5. However, 3x + 2 can never end in 5, so 5 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nC) 6: If 6 is a divisor of y, then y must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Since 3x + 2 is always odd, y can never be divisible by 2. Therefore, 6 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nD) 7: If 7 is a divisor of y, then we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we double the last digit of a number and subtract it from the remaining digits, the result must be divisible by 7. Applying this rule to 3x + 2, we get (3x - 1) + 3 = 3(x+1). Since we cannot apply the rule again to 3(x+1), we cannot determine if 7 is a divisor of y. Therefore, it is possible that 7 is not a divisor of y.\n\nE) 8: If 8 is a divisor of y, then y must be divisible by both 2 and 4. Since 3x + 2 is always odd, y can never be divisible by 2. Therefore, 8 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 7, as it cannot be determined if 7 is a divisor of y using the given information.",

To make the denominator an integer, we need to cancel out all the factors of 2 and 3 in the product of all positive integers less than 31. We can do this by dividing out all the even numbers and all the multiples of 3. However, we need to be careful not to divide out any number twice (i.e. any multiple of 6).

The greatest power of 2 that divides the numerator is $2^3$, so we need $2^{15-3}=2^{12}$ to divide $S/18^k$. For this to happen, we need to divide out all the even numbers up to $2\\cdot12=24$. We also need $3^{2k-10}$ to divide $S$, which means we need to divide out all the multiples of 3 up to $3\\cdot(2k-10)$.

This happens twice, so we need to subtract 2 from 30, giving us 28 times. However, we also need to add 1 because they toll together at the 30-minute mark. Therefore, the answer is 28+1 = 29 times.

To find out how many cows B can put in for the remaining 3 months, we need to know how many cow-months are left. \n\nThe total number of cow-months for 10 months is 10x. A uses 560 cow-months, so there are 10x - 560 cow-months left for B to use. \n\nB uses the pasture for 3 months, so the number of cow-months he can put in is 3y, where y is the number of cows he can put in.

Provide the answer followed by the explanation.. ",
            "Response": "Let's call the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell \"x\". \n\nIf he divides it equally among 35 regular customers, each customer will receive x/35 pastry goods. \n\nIf only 49 customers come, each customer will receive (x/35)-6 pastry goods. \n\nWe can set up an equation: \n\n(x/35)-6 = x/49 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35*49 (the least common multiple of 35 and 49) gives: \n\n49x - 35*6*x = 35*49*x \n\nSimplifying: \n\n49x - 210x = 1715x \n\n-161x = 0 \n\nx = 0 \n\nThis doesn't make sense - it means the confectioner doesn't need to sell any pastry goods at all! \n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our equation. When we multiplied both sides by 35*49, we assumed that the number of pastry goods sold would be the same in both scenarios (dividing equally among 35 customers and giving 6 less to 49 customers). But this isn't necessarily true - the confectioner might need to sell more pastry goods to make up for the 6 less each customer will receive if there are 49 customers. \n\nLet's try again, but this time we'll call the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell \"y\" in the second scenario (49 customers receiving 6 less each). \n\nIf he divides it equally among 35 regular customers, each customer will receive y/35-6 pastry goods. \n\nWe can set up an equation: \n\ny/35-6 = x/35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35 gives: \n\ny-210 = x \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\nx = y-210 \n\ny/35-6 = x/35 \n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second: \n\ny/35-6 = (y-210)/35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35 gives: \n\ny-210 = y-7350/35 \n\nSimplifying: \n\ny-210 = y-210 \n\nThis is true for any value of y! So we don't have a unique solution. \n\nHowever, we can still answer the question by finding the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell in either scenario. \n\nIf he divides it equally among 35 regular customers, each customer will receive x/35 pastry goods. So the total amount of pastry goods he needs to sell is: \n\nx = 35 * (amount each customer receives) \n\nWe can use either equation to find the amount each customer receives. Let's use the second equation: \n\ny/35-6 = x/35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35 gives: \n\ny-210 = x \n\nSubstituting x = 35 * (y/35-6): \n\ny-210 = 35 * (y/35-6) \n\nSimplifying: \n\ny-210 = y-210 \n\nThis is true for any value of y, so we still don't have a unique solution. \n\nHowever, we can use the answer choices to help us. We know that the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell is a multiple of 35 (since he's dividing it equally among 35 customers). \n\nThe only answer choice that's a multiple of 35 is A) 525. So let's see if that works. \n\nIf he sells 525 pastry goods and divides them equally among 35 customers, each customer will receive 525/35 = 15 pastry goods. \n\nIf only 49 customers come, each customer will receive 15-6 = 9 pastry goods. \n\nSo the total number of pastry goods given to customers is: \n\n35 * 15 = 525 \n\n49 * 9 = 441 \n\nTotal: 525 + 441 = 966 \n\nThis matches the total number of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell (525), so the answer is A) 525.",

            "Response": "There are two possibilities for selecting two chips of different colors: either a red chip is selected first and then a blue chip, or a blue chip is selected first and then a red chip. \n\nThe probability of selecting a red chip first is 4/8 (since there are 4 red chips out of 8 total chips), and the probability of selecting a blue chip second, given that a red chip was selected first, is 4/7 (since there are now only 7 chips left, and 4 of them are blue). Therefore, the probability of selecting a red chip first and then a blue chip is (4/8) * (4/7) = 16/56. \n\nSimilarly, the probability of selecting a blue chip first and then a red chip is (4/8) * (4/7) = 16/56. \n\nAdding these probabilities together gives a total probability of (16/56) + (16/56) = 32/56 = 8/14 = 4/7. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B) 4/7.",

Since $21=3\\cdot 7$, we know that $21^k$ is a divisor of 435,961 if and only if $7^k$ is a divisor of 435,961 and $3^k$ is a divisor of 435,961. Since 435,961 is not divisible by 3, we know that $3^k$ must be equal to 1, which means that $k$ is a multiple of 2. \n\nTherefore, we can write $k=2m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Then $7^k=(7^2)^m$ and $k^7=(2m)^7=128m^7$. We want to find $7^k-k^7$, which is equal to $(7^2)^m-128m^7$. \n\nSince $7^2$ is a factor of 435,961, we know that $7^2$ is a factor of $(7^2)^m$. Since $128=2^7$, we know that $128m^7$ is divisible by 2. Therefore, $7^k-k^7$ is divisible by both 2 and $7^2$. \n\nSince $7^k-k^7$ is an integer, we know that $7^k-k^7$ is divisible by the greatest common divisor of 2 and $7^2$, which is 2.

So, there are 3 ways to choose the second person and 2 ways to seat them next to Mary.\n\nNow, we have two males and one female seated. The next person to be seated must be a female, since no two females can sit next to each other. There are three females to choose from, and once one is chosen, there are two remaining females who can sit next to the male who is not next to Mary. So, there are 3 ways to choose the third person and 2 ways to seat them.\n\nNow, we have two males and two females seated. The next person to be seated must be a male, since no two males can sit next to each other. There are two males to choose from, and once one is chosen, there is only one remaining male who can sit next to the female who is not next to Mary. So, there are 2 ways to choose the fourth person and 1 way to seat them.\n\nNow, we have three males and two females seated. The next person to be seated must be a female, since no two females can sit next to each other. There is only one female left to choose from, and she must sit next to the male who is not next to Mary.\n\nFinally, we have three males and three females seated, with Mary seated with her back to the wall and no two males or females sitting next to each other. There are 3! ways to arrange the males and 3! ways to arrange the females, so the total number of ways to seat everyone is:\n\n3 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 1 x 3! x 3! = 72\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 72.",

Therefore, the total number of parts they planned to make is:\n\nd days x 25 parts/day = 25d parts\n\nNow we know that the company started making 5 more parts per day after the first 3 days. Let's call this new production rate \"p\":\n\np = 25 parts/day + 5 parts/day = 30 parts/day\n\nWe also know that by the last day of work, they had produced 100 more parts than planned. Therefore, the total number of parts they made is:\n\n25d parts + 100 parts = (3 days x 25 parts/day) + (d - 3 days) x 30 parts/day\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n25d + 100 = 75 + 30d - 90\n55d = 115\nd = 2.09 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the company worked for:\n\nd = 3 days\n\nNow we can find the total number of parts they made:\n\n25d parts + 100 parts = 25 x 3 + 30 x (3 - 3) + 100 = 75 + 100 = 175 parts\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 347, since the question asks for the total number of parts made, not just the extra parts produced on the last day.",

Then we have $lw+lh+wh=2(2l+2h+wh)$, since the surface area of the foil covered prism is equal to the surface area of the $128$ cubes plus the surface area of the remaining part of the prism. Simplifying this equation gives $lw-4l-4h+wh-8=0$. We also know that the volume of the foil covered prism is equal to the volume of the $128$ cubes plus the volume of the remaining part of the prism, so we have $lwh=128+wh$. Solving for $h$ in the second equation gives $h=\\frac{128}{lw-1}$. Substituting this into the first equation and simplifying gives $lw-4l-\\frac{512}{lw-1}-8=0$. Let $x=lw$. Then we have the quadratic equation $x^2-4x-520=0$, which factors as $(x-26)(x+20)=0$. Since $l$ and $w$ are positive, we have $lw=x=26$. Finally, we know that the width of the figure created by the $128$ cubes is twice the length and twice the height, so it has dimensions $2l\\times 2h=52\\times\\frac{256}{25}$. Therefore, the width of the foil covered prism is $w=\\frac{lw}{h}=\\frac{26}{\\frac{128}{wh}}=\\frac{26}{\\frac{128}{\\frac{256}{25}}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }8}$.",

Since Peeta said it's currently 6am, we know that 12 hours later would be 6pm.

But we also need to account for the .997 years. \n\nAssuming a standard 365-day year, .997 years is approximately 364 days. \n\nSo, if it's currently 6am on January 1st, 2200, then 23,999,986 hours later would be at 6am on December 30th, 4939. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C) 4am, since 23,999,986 hours later would be just 2 hours before the original time of 6am.",

            "Response": "The sequence alternates between positive and negative terms. The sum of the first 200 terms can be split into two sums: the sum of the first 100 positive terms and the sum of the first 100 negative terms. \n\nThe sum of the first 100 positive terms is 1+3+5+7+...+199. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2 and a first term of 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nsum = (number of terms) * (average of terms)\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence is 100, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last term, which is (1+199)/2 = 100. So the sum of the first 100 positive terms is:\n\nsum = 100 * 100 = 10,000\n\nSimilarly, the sum of the first 100 negative terms is:\n\nsum = -2 -4 -6 -8 -...-200\n\nThis is also an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -2 and a first term of -2. The number of terms is again 100, and the average of the terms is (-2-200)/2 = -101. So the sum of the first 100 negative terms is:\n\nsum = 100 * (-101) = -10,100\n\nAdding these two sums together, we get:\n\nsum = 10,000 - 10,100 = -100\n\nFinally, to find the average of the first 200 terms, we divide the sum by the number of terms:\n\naverage = sum/number of terms = -100/200 = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the answer is A) -1/2.",

Therefore, $N$ must be a divisor of $224$. We also know that $N$ leaves the same remainder when dividing $1305$, $4665$, and $6905$, so $N$ must be a divisor of their common remainder when divided by $224$.

We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the other equation. \n\nSolving for w in the second equation, we get: \n\nw = 8d/31 \n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get: \n\n2d/((8d/31) + r) = 25/8 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nr = 8d/39 \n\nNow we can use either equation to find the total time it would take to ride both ways. Let's use the first equation: \n\n2d/(w+r) = 2d/((8d/31) + (8d/39)) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n2d/(w+r) = 496/39 \n\n2d/(w+r) = 128/10 \n\n2d/(w+r) = 64/5 \n\nTherefore, the total time it would take to ride both ways is 64/5 hours, which is equivalent to 12 4/5 hours or approximately 4 3/4 hours. \n\nThe answer is (C) 4 3/4 hours.",

During those 5 minutes, the cyclist travels a distance of:\n\ndistance = rate x time = 28 mph x (5/60) hours = 2.3333 miles\n\nNow, the hiker is walking and the cyclist is waiting. We want to know how long it will take for the hiker to catch up to the cyclist. Let's call that time \"t\" (in minutes). During that time, the hiker will travel a distance of:\n\ndistance = rate x time = 0.1167 miles per minute x t minutes = 0.1167t miles\n\nThe cyclist will still be at the same spot where they stopped, so their distance will be 2.3333 miles.

            "Response": "The vowels in the word ASTERIX are A, E, and I. Since we want them to appear in alphabetical order, we can consider them as a single unit AEI.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements where the vowels appear in alphabetical order is 120 x 6 = 720. But we can also have the vowels in reverse alphabetical order, which gives us another 720 arrangements. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where the vowels appear in either alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order is 720 + 720 = 1440.

            "Response": "The ratio of monster books to space travel books is 4:5. This means that for every 4 monster books, there are 5 space travel books. \n\nIf Yukou currently has 20 space travel books, we can use this ratio to find out how many monster books he has: \n\n4/5 = x/20 \n\nCross-multiplying, we get: \n\n5x = 80 \n\nx = 16 \n\nSo Yukou currently has 16 monster books. \n\nTo read a book every week for a year, he needs to read 52 books in total. If we assume that he will read an equal number of monster and space travel books, he will need 26 of each. \n\nHe currently has 16 monster books, so he needs to buy: \n\n26 - 16 = 10 monster books \n\nHe currently has 20 space travel books, so he needs to buy: \n\n26 - 20 = 6 space travel books \n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 6 monster, 10 space.",

We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512  Provide the answer followed by the explanation.. ",
            "Response": "We first note that the order of the cards within each envelope does not matter, since multiplication is commutative. Thus, we can represent each envelope as a set of primes, and the number of possible sets of primes is simply the number of ways to partition the set of primes into three non-empty subsets. \n\nThere are only two ways to partition a set of size 2 into three non-empty subsets: $(1,1,2)$ and $(1,2,1)$. Thus, we can ignore the primes 2 and 3, since they cannot be split into three non-empty subsets. \n\nThe remaining primes are 5, 7, 11, and 13. There are 5 ways to partition this set into three non-empty subsets: $(5,7,11,13)$, $(5,7,11)(13)$, $(5,7,13)(11)$, $(5,11,13)(7)$, and $(7,11,13)(5)$. \n\nFor each partition, we can compute the three envelope numbers and put them in order. For example, if we use the partition $(5,7,11)(13)$, the envelope numbers are 385, 13, and 1, which gives us the set $(1,13,385)$. \n\nWe can repeat this process for each of the 5 partitions, giving us a total of 5 sets. However, we also need to consider the case where all the primes are in the same envelope. There are 4 ways to choose which envelope this is, so we get 4 additional sets. \n\nThus, the total number of sets is $5+4=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }41}$.",

            "Response": "Answer: D) 16 2/3\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's assume that x liters of water must be evaporated from 50 liters of a 3-percent sugar solution to get a 3-percent solution.\n\nInitially, the amount of sugar in the solution is:\n\n3% of 50 liters = (3/100) x 50 = 1.5 liters\n\nAfter x liters of water is evaporated, the total volume of the solution becomes (50-x) liters. Since the amount of sugar in the solution remains constant, we can set up the following equation:\n\n1.5 liters = (3/100) x (50-x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1.5 = (3/100) x 50 - (3/100) x x\n1.5 = 1.5 - (3/100) x^2\n(3/100) x^2 = 0\nx^2 = 0\nx = 0 or x = 100\n\nSince we need to evaporate some water to get a 3-percent solution, x cannot be 0. Therefore, x = 100 is not a valid solution.\n\nThus, the amount of water that needs to be evaporated is:\n\n50 - x = 50 - 16 2/3 = 33 1/3 liters\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B) 33 1/3.",

            "Response": "The length of the platform is given by:\nLength = Speed x Time taken to pass the platform\nLet's first convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s:\n54 km/hr = (54 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 15 m/s\nNow, let's consider the time taken by the train to pass the platform. During this time, the front of the train travels a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the platform. So, let's assume that the length of the platform is L meters. Then, we can write:\nL + length of train = speed x time taken to pass the platform\nL + length of train = 15 x 36\nL + length of train = 540\nSimilarly, during the time taken by the train to pass the man, only the length of the train is covered.

",
            "Response": "The car can travel for 20 minutes at 60 mph on 1 gallon of gasoline, which is equivalent to 20/60 = 1/3 of an hour. Therefore, the car can travel 60/1/3 = 180 miles on 1 gallon of gasoline at 60 mph.\n\nIf the car had 8 gallons of gasoline left after traveling 80 miles, then it used a total of 8 + 80/180 = 8.44 gallons of gasoline. The percentage of the tank used is (8.44/8) x 100% = 105.5%.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the percentage of the tank used to travel 80 miles, so we need to subtract the percentage of the tank remaining after traveling 80 miles. The car can travel 180 x 8 = 1440 miles on a full tank of gasoline, so after traveling 80 miles, there is (1440-80)/1440 = 0.9444 or 94.44% of the tank remaining.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the tank used to travel 80 miles at 60 mph is (105.5% - 94.44%) = 11.06%, which is closest to option B) 20%.",

The probability of getting tails on one flip is also 1/2. \n\nTo find the probability of getting at least two heads in five flips, we can use the binomial probability formula: \n\nP(X \u2265 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) \n\nwhere X is the number of heads in five flips. \n\nP(X < 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) \n\nTo find these probabilities, we can use the binomial probability formula again: \n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k) \n\nwhere n is the number of trials (in this case, 5), k is the number of successes (heads), and p is the probability of success (1/2). \n\nP(X = 0) = (5 choose 0) * (1/2)^0 * (1/2)^5 = 1/32 \n\nP(X = 1) = (5 choose 1) * (1/2)^1 * (1/2)^4 = 5/32 \n\nTherefore, \n\nP(X < 2) = 1/32 + 5/32 = 6/32 = 3/16 \n\nAnd, \n\nP(X \u2265 2) = 1 - P(X < 2) = 1 - 3/16 = 13/16 \n\nSo the answer is (D) 13/16.",
