So, there are x members in the band excluding Jim and Ellen, and x+2 members in the band including Jim and Ellen. We are given that there are 6 possible combinations in which Jim and Ellen are not selected. This means that we need to choose 2 members from the x members excluding Jim and Ellen. This can be done in C(x,2) ways, where C(x,2) is the number of combinations of choosing 2 members from x members. We are given that C(x,2) = 6.\n\nNow, we know that C(x,2) = x! / (2! * (x-2)!), where x! is the factorial of x. Plugging in the given value, we get:\n\n6 = x! / (2! * (x-2)!)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.
