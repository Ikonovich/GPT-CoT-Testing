            "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks before they meet \"x\". This means that Friend P walks the remaining distance of 43-x before they meet. \n\nNow let's use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nWe know that Friend P walks 15% faster than Friend Q, so we can set up the equation: \n\n43-x = 1.15rP * t \n\nx = rQ * t \n\nwhere rP is Friend P's rate and rQ is Friend Q's rate. \n\nWe can solve for t in the second equation: \n\nt = x/rQ \n\nNow we can substitute this into the first equation: \n\n43-x = 1.15rP * (x/rQ) \n\nSimplifying: \n\n43-x = 1.15(rP/rQ) * x \n\n43 = (1.15(rP/rQ) + 1) * x \n\nx = 43 / (1.15(rP/rQ) + 1) \n\nWe want to find how many kilometers Friend P has walked when they meet, so we can substitute this value of x into Friend P's equation: \n\n43 - x = 1.15rP * t \n\n43 - 43/(1.15(rP/rQ) + 1) = 1.15rP * t \n\nSimplifying: \n\n1.15rP * t = 43/(1.15(rP/rQ) + 1) \n\nt = 43/(1.15(rP/rQ) + 1) / 1.15rP \n\nt = 43 / (1.15^2 * (rP/rQ) + 1.15rP) \n\nNow we can substitute this value of t into Friend P's equation to find how far they have walked: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\ndistance = 1.15rP * t \n\ndistance = 1.15rP * 43 / (1.15^2 * (rP/rQ) + 1.15rP) \n\nSimplifying: \n\ndistance = 43 * (rP/rQ) / (1.15(rP/rQ) + 1) \n\nWe can simplify this further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 1.15: \n\ndistance = 43 * (1.15 * rP/rQ) / (1.15 * (1.15 * rP/rQ) + 1.15) \n\ndistance = 43 * (1.15 * rP/rQ) / (1.3225 * rP/rQ + 1.15) \n\ndistance = 43 * 1.15 * rP / (1.3225 * rP + 1.15 * rQ) \n\nNow we can plug in some numbers. Let's say Friend Q's rate is 5 km/h. Then Friend P's rate is 1.15 * 5 = 5.75 km/h. \n\ndistance = 43 * 1.15 * 5.75 / (1.3225 * 5.75 + 1.15 * 5) \n\ndistance = 22.5 \n\nSo Friend P will have walked 22.5 km when they meet. \n\nThe answer is (D) 22.5.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find out how much interest Carl pays each quarter. We can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\nA = the amount after t years\nP = the principal (initial amount)\nr = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\nn = the number of times the interest is compounded per year\nt = the time in years\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nP = $10,000\nr = 4% = 0.04\nn = 4 (since the interest is compounded quarterly)\nt = 1/4 (since we want to find the interest for one quarter)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = $10,000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*1/4)\nA = $10,000(1.01)^1\nA = $10,100\n\nSo Carl's loan balance after one quarter is $10,100. Since he can only pay the interest, he will owe the full $10,100 at the end of the quarter. Therefore, the interest he pays for one quarter is:\n\n$10,100 - $10,000 = $100\n\nTo find the annual interest, we simply multiply this by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):\n\n$100 * 4 = $400\n\nSo Carl pays approximately $400 in interest each year.

            "Response": "First, we need to know that the perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Let's say the side length of square P is x. Then, we know that:\n\n4x = 40\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 10\n\nSo, the side length of square P is 10. Now, we need to find the diameter of circle Q, which is also the diagonal of square P. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the diagonal:\n\nd^2 = x^2 + x^2\n\nd^2 = 2x^2\n\nd = x\u221a2\n\nd = 10\u221a2\n\nFinally, we can find the circumference of circle Q using the formula:\n\nC = \u03c0d\n\nC = \u03c0(10\u221a2)\n\nC = 10\u03c0\u221a2\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 10\u221a2\u03c0.",
