            "Response": "To find the pattern in the sequence, we can look at the differences between consecutive numbers. The difference between 10 and 4 is 6. Let's assume the sequence has a constant difference between consecutive numbers. \n\nIf the difference between consecutive numbers is 6, then the next number after 10 would be 10 + 6 = 16. However, this does not fit the pattern, as the next number after 16 would be 16 + 6 = 22, and the next number after 22 would be 22 + 6 = 28, which is not equal to 46.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Instead of a constant difference, let's assume the sequence has a constant second difference (i.e., the differences between consecutive differences are constant). The difference between 10 and 4 is 6. Let's call the difference between X and 10 as Y. Then, the difference between 46 and X is Y + 6 (since we are assuming a constant second difference). Similarly, the difference between 94 and 46 is Y + 12.\n\nNow, we can write the following equations:\n\nX - 10 = Y\n46 - X = Y + 6\n94 - 46 = Y + 12\n\nFrom the second equation, we can find X in terms of Y:\n\nX = 46 - Y - 6\nX = 40 - Y\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for X in the first equation:\n\n40 - Y - 10 = Y\n30 - Y = Y\n\nAdding Y to both sides, we get:\n\n30 = 2Y\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nY = 15\n\nNow, we can find X using the expression we found earlier:\n\nX = 40 - Y\nX = 40 - 15\nX = 25\n\nHowever, 25 is not one of the options. Let's double-check our work. If Y = 15, then the sequence would be:\n\n4, 10, 25, 46, 94\n\nThe differences between consecutive numbers are:\n\n6, 15, 21, 48\n\nThe second differences are:\n\n9, 6, 27\n\nThis does not have a constant second difference, so our assumption was incorrect. Let's try a different approach.\n\nInstead of a constant second difference, let's assume the sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive numbers. Let's call the ratio R. Then, the sequence can be written as:\n\n4, 4R, 4R^2, 4R^3, 4R^4\n\nNow, we can write the following equations:\n\n4R = 10\n4R^2 = X\n4R^3 = 46\n4R^4 = 94\n\nFrom the first equation, we can find R:\n\nR = 10/4\nR = 2.5\n\nNow, we can find X using the second equation:\n\nX = 4(2.5)^2\nX = 4(6.25)\nX = 25\n\nAgain, we found X = 25, which is not one of the options. However, we made an error in our calculation of R. The correct value of R should be:\n\nR = 10 / 4\nR = 5 / 2\n\nNow, we can find X using the second equation:\n\nX = 4(5/2)^2\nX = 4(25/4)\nX = 25\n\nAgain, we found X = 25, which is not one of the options. This means that the sequence does not have a constant ratio between consecutive numbers.\n\nAt this point, we have tried all reasonable approaches to find the pattern in the sequence, and none of them have resulted in a value of X that matches one of the options.

The complementary event of A \u2229 B is A' \u222a B', which is the event that a customer does not buy a bagel or does not buy a coffee. We can find the probability of A' \u222a B' using the formula:\n\nP(A' \u222a B') = P(A') + P(B') - P(A' \u2229 B')\n\nSince A' and B' are complementary events, we have P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 2/5 and P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 2/7. Now we need to find the probability of A' \u2229 B', which is the event that a customer does not buy a bagel and does not buy a coffee. Since the customers are selected independently, we have:\n\nP(A' \u2229 B') = P(A') * P(B') = (2/5) * (2/7) = 4/35\n\nNow we can find the probability of A' \u222a B':\n\nP(A' \u222a B') = P(A') + P(B') - P(A' \u2229 B') = (2/5) + (2/7) - (4/35) = 14/35\n\nNow we can find the probability of A \u2229 B using the complementary probability:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = 1 - P(A' \u222a B') = 1 - 14/35 = 21/35\n\nNow we want to find the probability that at least 1 out of 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee.

To do this, we need to find the speed at which the bus should travel to minimize the cost. The total cost per hour can be written as:\n\nCost per hour = (C * cost per litre) + other expenses per hour\nCost per hour = (C * 60) + 60\n\nWe want to minimize the cost per hour, so we can take the derivative of the cost per hour with respect to the speed and set it equal to 0:\n\nd(Cost per hour)/dS = 0\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\nd(Cost per hour)/dC * dC/dS = 0\n\nPlugging in the equation for C, we get:\n\n(60 * (1/3600) * 2 * S) = 0\n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS = 0\n\nHowever, a speed of 0 kmph is not practical, so we need to find the next minimum value. To do this, we can look at the second derivative of the cost per hour with respect to the speed:\n\nd^2(Cost per hour)/dS^2 = 60 * (1/3600) * 2\n\nSince the second derivative is positive, this means that the cost per hour is minimized at the next minimum value of S. Since the cost per hour is minimized when the bus is traveling at 60 kmph, we can use this speed to find the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km.\n\nAt 60 kmph, the bus will take 600 / 60 = 10 hours to cover the distance. The cost per hour at this speed is:\n\nCost per hour = (1 * 60) + 60 = 120\n\nSo, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is:\n\nExpenditure = Cost per hour * time\nExpenditure = 120 * 10 = 1200\n\nTherefore, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is $1200. The correct answer is C) 1200.",

Since the time taken by train B to cover y km is 4 hours, we can write the equation:\n\ny = v * 4\ny = 4v\n\nSince the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the sum of the distances covered by both trains after meeting each other is equal to the total distance between the two points.

            "Response": "Let's break down the process into steps:\n\n1. The person with the bike takes the first person across the stretch (300 km at 50 kmph). This takes 300/50 = 6 hours.\n2. During these 6 hours, the other two people have been running at 10 kmph, so they have covered 6*10 = 60 km.\n3. The person with the bike comes back to pick up the second person. Since the second person has covered 60 km, the bike has to travel 300 - 60 = 240 km back. This takes 240/50 = 4.8 hours.\n4. The person with the bike takes the second person across the stretch (300 km at 50 kmph). This takes 300/50 = 6 hours.\n5. During these 6 hours, the last person has been running at 10 kmph, so he has covered 6*10 = 60 km. However, he had already covered 60 km in the first 6 hours, so now he has covered a total of 60 + 60 = 120 km.\n6. The person with the bike comes back to pick up the last person. Since the last person has covered 120 km, the bike has to travel 300 - 120 = 180 km back. This takes 180/50 = 3.6 hours.\n7. The person with the bike takes the last person across the stretch (300 km at 50 kmph). This takes 300/50 = 6 hours.\n\nAdding up all the time spent, we get 6 + 4.8 + 6 + 3.6 + 6 = 26.4 hours. However, this is not one of the options given. Let's check if we made a mistake in our calculations.\n\nIn step 3, the person with the bike comes back to pick up the second person. Since the second person has covered 60 km, the bike has to travel 300 - 60 = 240 km back. This takes 240/50 = 4.8 hours. However, during these 4.8 hours, the second person has also been running at 10 kmph, so he has covered an additional 4.8*10 = 48 km. Therefore, the bike only needs to travel 240 - 48 = 192 km back, which takes 192/50 = 3.84 hours.\n\nSimilarly, in step 6, the person with the bike comes back to pick up the last person. Since the last person has covered 120 km, the bike has to travel 300 - 120 = 180 km back. This takes 180/50 = 3.6 hours. However, during these 3.6 hours, the last person has also been running at 10 kmph, so he has covered an additional 3.6*10 = 36 km. Therefore, the bike only needs to travel 180 - 36 = 144 km back, which takes 144/50 = 2.88 hours.\n\nNow, adding up all the time spent, we get 6 + 3.84 + 6 + 2.88 + 6 = 24.72 hours. This is still not one of the options given. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet x be the time it takes for the whole process to complete. Then, during this time, the three people who are running will have covered a distance of 10x km each. The person with the bike will have traveled a total distance of 50x km.\n\nThe person with the bike travels 300 km each time he takes someone across the stretch, and he does this three times. He also travels back twice, once after taking the first person and once after taking the second person. Let d1 be the distance he travels back after taking the first person, and let d2 be the distance he travels back after taking the second person. Then, we have:\n\n50x = 3*300 + d1 + d2\n\nSince the first person runs for the entire time x, we have:\n\n10x = 300 + d1\n\nSimilarly, since the second person runs for the entire time x except for the time it takes the person with the bike to travel back after taking the first person, we have:\n\n10x - 10*(d1/50) = 300 + d2\n\nNow, we have a system of three equations with three unknowns:\n\n50x = 3*300 + d1 + d2\n10x = 300 + d1\n10x - 10*(d1/50) = 300 + d2\n\nSolving this system, we get x = 56/3 hours.

In chemical X, the ratio of raw materials A and B is 1 : 3, so there are 3 units of raw material B for every 4 units of chemical X. In chemical Y, the ratio of raw materials B and C is 2 : 1, so there are 2 units of raw material B for every 3 units of chemical Y.\n\nSince product M is produced by mixing chemical X and chemical Y in the ratio of 5 : 4, there must be 5 units of chemical X for every 9 units of product M, and 4 units of chemical Y for every 9 units of product M.\n\nNow let's find the amount of raw material B in 9 units of product M.

There are 4 units of chemical Y in 9 units of product M, so there are 4 * (2/3) = 8/3 units of raw material B from chemical Y.

This means we will find the number of selections that do not include any paperbacks and subtract that from the total number of possible selections.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible selections of 3 books from the shelf. We can use the combination formula for this:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of books (8) and k is the number of books we want to select (3).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\nNow, let's find the number of selections that do not include any paperbacks. This means we are only selecting from the 6 hardback books.\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6*5*4) / (3*2*1) = 20\n\nFinally, subtract the number of selections without paperbacks from the total number of selections:\n\n56 - 20 = 36\n\nSo there are 36 possible selections of 3 books that include at least one paperback.

So, we can write the equation as:\n\nX = 0.8 * ((26/3) + Y/4)\n\nWe also know that the average of X and Y is 26.

So, the total work done by 10 men in 55 days is 10M * 55.\n\nSince both groups can complete the same project, their total work is equal. Therefore, we have:\n\n15W * 55 = 10M * 55\n\nDivide both sides by 55:\n\n15W = 10M\n\nNow, we need to find the number of days it will take for 5 women and 4 men to complete the project.

So, the cistern is already (1/10 + 1/15) * 4 = (2/30 + 1/15) * 4 = (1/6) * 4 = 2/3 full.\n\nNow, the person closes the waste pipe, and in another 4 minutes, the cistern is full. So, in these 4 minutes, pipes A and B together fill the remaining 1/3 of the cistern. Therefore, (1/10 + 1/15) * 4 = 1/3.\n\nNow, let's find the value of 1/x. Since the waste pipe was open for the first 4 minutes, we can write the equation:\n\n(1/10 + 1/15 - 1/x) * 4 = 2/3\n\nSolving for 1/x, we get:\n\n1/x = (1/10 + 1/15) * 4 - 2/3\n1/x = (2/30 + 1/15) * 4 - 2/3\n1/x = 1/6 - 2/3\n1/x = -1/2\n\nSince the value of 1/x is negative, it means that the waste pipe is emptying the cistern. To find the time taken by the waste pipe to empty the cistern, we take the reciprocal of -1/2:\n\nx = 1 / (-1/2)\nx = -2\n\nSo, the waste pipe can empty the cistern in 2 minutes.

The angle covered by the hour hand in 12 hours is 360 degrees, so the angle covered by the hour hand in (8 + m/60) hours is (360/12) * (8 + m/60) = 30 * (8 + m/60) degrees.\n\nSimilarly, the angle covered by the minute hand in 60 minutes is 360 degrees, so the angle covered by the minute hand in 'm' minutes is (360/60) * m = 6m degrees.\n\nWhen the hands are in the same straight line but not together, the angle between them should be 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:\n\n30 * (8 + m/60) - 6m = 180\n\nSolving for 'm':\n\n240 + m/2 - 6m = 180\nm/2 = 60 - 6m\nm = 120 - 12m\n13m = 120\nm = 120/13 = 12x10/11\n\nSo, the hands will be in the same straight line but not together at 12x10/11 minutes past 8 o'clock.",

            "Response": "Let the total capacity of tank B be x liters. According to the given information, after 21 hours, tank B is 1/32 filled. So, the amount of water in tank B after 21 hours is x/32.\n\nThe water filling pattern in tank B is a geometric progression with the first term a = 10 and the common ratio r = 2. The sum of the first 21 terms of this geometric progression is x/32.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression is:\n\nS_n = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)\n\nIn this case, S_21 = x/32, a = 10, r = 2, and n = 21. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx/32 = 10 * (2^21 - 1) / (2 - 1)\n\nx/32 = 10 * (2097152 - 1)\n\nx/32 = 10 * 2097151\n\nx = 32 * 10 * 2097151\n\nx = 671088640\n\nNow we know the total capacity of tank B is 671088640 liters. To find the total duration required to fill it completely, we need to find the number of hours it takes for the geometric progression to reach this value.\n\nLet n be the number of hours required to fill tank B completely.

Then, the distance travelled by the first train is (x + 100) km.\n\nSince the trains are travelling towards each other, their relative speed is (50 + 40) km/hr = 90 km/hr.\n\nThe time taken for the trains to meet is the same for both trains. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\nx/40 = (x + 100)/50\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n50x = 40(x + 100)\n50x = 40x + 4000\n10x = 4000\nx = 400\n\nSo, the distance travelled by the second train is 400 km, and the distance travelled by the first train is 400 + 100 = 500 km.\n\nThe distance between P and Q is the sum of the distances travelled by both trains, which is 400 + 500 = 900 km.\n\nThe answer is C) 900 km.",

Since 3000 is divisible by 2, the 3000th digit will be the same as the last digit in the repeating block, which is 4. \n\nTherefore, the 3000th digit to the right of the decimal place is 4. However, this is not one of the answer choices. It's possible that the problem was intended to ask for the 2999th digit instead. In that case, the answer would be the first digit in the repeating block, which is 5. \n\nSo, the answer is C) 5.",

            "Response": "Let x be the number of liters of Liquid Q that must be added to the mixture. Then, the total volume of the mixture will be 30+x liters. The volume of Liquid P in the mixture remains the same, which is 18 liters (since the ratio of Liquid P to Liquid Q in the initial mixture is 3:2, and the total volume is 30 liters, we have 3 parts of Liquid P and 2 parts of Liquid Q, so 1 part is equal to 30/5=6 liters, and 3 parts of Liquid P is equal to 18 liters).\n\nNow, we want the ratio of Liquid P to Liquid Q in the new mixture to be 3:4. Since the volume of Liquid P is 18 liters, we can write the equation:\n\n18/(12+x) = 3/4\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 and by (12+x), we get:\n\n72 = 3*(12+x)\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\n24 = 12+x\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 12\n\nSo, 12 liters of Liquid Q must be added to the mixture to make the ratio 3:4.\n\nAnswer: C) 12",

Since 180 is not a square number itself, we need to find the smallest square number that is a multiple of 180. To do this, we can multiply 180 by the smallest missing prime factor to make it a square number. In this case, the missing prime factor is 5 (since we have 2^2 and 3^2, but only one 5).\n\nSo, the smallest square number that is a multiple of 180 is 180 * 5 = 900.\n\nTherefore, the least square number which is exactly divisible by 10, 12, 15, and 18 is 900 (option A).",

            "Response": "To connect each city to all other cities with a single road segment, we need to find the number of unique pairs of cities that can be formed. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of cities and k is the number of cities in each pair (which is 2 in this case).\n\nSo, C(15, 2) = 15! / (2!(15-2)!) = 15! / (2!13!) = (15*14) / (2*1) = 105.\n\nTherefore, 105 road segments are required to connect all the cities.\n\nThe answer is B) 105.",

            "Response": "Let x be the number of one-bedroom units and y be the number of two-bedroom units. We know that x + y = 441.\n\nWe also know that 4/7 of the units are rented, so 4/7 * 441 = 252 units are rented.\n\nSince 1/5 of the one-bedroom units are rented, we have (1/5)x rented one-bedroom units. And since there is a 6:1 ratio of rented two-bedroom units to rented one-bedroom units, we have 6(1/5)x = (6/5)x rented two-bedroom units.\n\nNow we can write an equation for the total number of rented units: (1/5)x + (6/5)x = 252. Combining the terms on the left side, we get (7/5)x = 252. Dividing both sides by 7/5, we find that x = 180.\n\nNow we can find the number of two-bedroom units: y = 441 - x = 441 - 180 = 261.\n\nSince 6/5 of the rented one-bedroom units are two-bedroom units, there are (6/5)(180/5) = 216 rented two-bedroom units.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of two-bedroom units that are not rented: 261 - 216 = 45.\n\nSo there are 45 two-bedroom units that are not rented.

Then, the combined rate of A, B, and C is (W/7) + x.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\n(W/7) + x = W/5\n\nTo solve for x, we can first get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides by 35:\n\n5W + 35x = 7W\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n35x = 2W\nx = 2W/35\n\nSince x is the rate of C alone, the time C takes to complete the work alone is the reciprocal of x:\n\nTime taken by C alone = 1/x = 35/(2W)\n\nNow, we know that A and B together can complete the work in 7 days, so W = 7(AB), where AB is the combined rate of A and B. We also know that A, B, and C together can complete the work in 5 days, so W = 5(ABC), where ABC is the combined rate of A, B, and C.\n\nWe can set these two equations equal to each other:\n\n7(AB) = 5(ABC)\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n(7/5)(AB) = ABC\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our equation for the time taken by C alone:\n\nTime taken by C alone = 35/(2W) = 35/(2(7/5)(AB)) = 35/(14/5)(AB) = 35 * (5/14)(1/AB) = 35 * (1/2)(1/AB) = 35/2 * (1/AB)\n\nSince AB is the combined rate of A and B, and we know that A and B together can complete the work in 7 days, we can substitute 7 for AB:\n\nTime taken by C alone = 35/2 * (1/7) = 35/14 = 2.5\n\nSo, C alone can complete the work in 2.5 days.

In 1 hour, the pipe and the leakage together can fill 1/(7a) of the tank.\n\nSince the pipe fills the tank and the leakage empties it, the combined rate of the pipe and the leakage is the difference between their individual rates:\n\n1/a - 1/x = 1/(7a)\n\nTo solve for x, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\nx(7a) - a(7a) = a(x)\n\n7ax - 7a^2 = ax\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n7ax - ax = 7a^2\n\nx(7a - a) = 7a^2\n\nx = 7a^2 / (7a - a)\n\nx = 7a^2 / 6a\n\nx = 7a/6\n\nNow, we know that the time taken by the leakage to empty the tank is 7a/6 hours.

We can represent this as a sequence of stars and bars, where a star represents a prize and a bar separates the prizes for different boys.\n\nFor example, the sequence **|*|*| represents giving 2 prizes to the first boy, 1 prize to the second boy, and 1 prize to the third boy.\n\nWe can think of this as placing 3 stars and 3 bars in a row. There are a total of 6 positions, and we need to choose 3 of them to place the stars. The remaining positions will be filled with bars.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and k = 3, so the number of ways is:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6*5*4) / (3*2*1) = 20\n\nHowever, this does not account for the possibility that a boy gets no prizes.

This is because the problem statement is ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. If we assume that a boy can get any number of prizes, including 0, then the problem becomes a simple application of the multiplication principle.\n\nEach prize can be given to any of the 4 boys, so there are 4 choices for each prize.

            "Response": "To find the largest number of four digits which is exactly divisible by 27, 18, 12, and 15, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers and then find the largest multiple of the LCM that is less than 10000.\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 27, 18, 12, and 15. We can do this by finding the prime factorization of each number and then taking the highest power of each prime factor:\n\n27 = 3^3\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n15 = 3 * 5\n\nThe LCM is 2^2 * 3^3 * 5 = 4 * 27 * 5 = 540.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest multiple of 540 that is less than 10000. We can do this by dividing 10000 by 540 and rounding down:\n\n10000 / 540 = 18.5185...\n\nRounding down, we get 18. So, the largest multiple of 540 that is less than 10000 is 18 * 540 = 9720.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of four digits which is exactly divisible by 27, 18, 12, and 15 is 9720, which is option C.",

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest earned, P is the principal (the initial investment), r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years. In this case, we have I = $250, P = d, r = k/100 (since k is given as a percent), and t = 1 year.

            "Response": "We can use the divisibility rule for 3: a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, we need to form a five-digit number using all of these digits.\n\nThere are 5 choices for the first digit (it cannot be 0), 4 choices for the second digit, 3 choices for the third digit, 2 choices for the fourth digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. This gives us a total of 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120 ways to form a five-digit number using these digits.\n\nHowever, we have not yet accounted for the fact that the number must be divisible by 3. To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. Since the sum of the digits is 15, we know that the sum of the digits in the five-digit number must be a multiple of 3. There are two cases to consider:\n\n1) The sum of the digits is 15. In this case, we can use all of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. There are 5 choices for the first digit (it cannot be 0), 4 choices for the second digit, 3 choices for the third digit, 2 choices for the fourth digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. This gives us a total of 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120 ways to form a five-digit number in this case.\n\n2) The sum of the digits is 12. In this case, we must exclude one of the digits from the five-digit number. Since the sum of the digits is 12, we must exclude the digit 3. There are 4 choices for the first digit (it cannot be 0 or 3), 3 choices for the second digit, 2 choices for the third digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. This gives us a total of 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24 ways to form a five-digit number in this case.\n\nAdding the number of ways in both cases, we get a total of 120 + 24 = 144 ways to form a five-digit number divisible by 3 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition. However, this includes the cases where the first digit is 0, which is not allowed. To account for this, we can subtract the number of ways to form a four-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition. There are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 choices for the second digit, 2 choices for the third digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. This gives us a total of 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24 ways to form a four-digit number using these digits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to form a five-digit number divisible by 3 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition is 144 - 24 = 120 ways.

The number of favorable arrangements is:\n\n11! / (2! * 2! * 1! * 2! * 2!) = 39,916,800 / (2 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 2) = 1,997,920\n\nFinally, let's find the probability Q:\n\nQ = (number of favorable arrangements) / (total number of arrangements) = 1,997,920 / 1,038,670 \u2248 1/20\n\nSo, the probability Q is approximately 1/20, which corresponds to option B.",
