",
            "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks before they meet \"x\". This means that Friend P walks the remaining distance of 43-x. \n\nWe know that Friend P walks 15% faster than Friend Q, which means that their speeds are in a 1.15:1 ratio. \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up an equation: \n\nx = Q's rate x time \n43 - x = P's rate x time \n\nWe can substitute P's rate as 1.15Q's rate: \n\nx = Q's rate x time \n43 - x = 1.15Q's rate x time \n\nWe can solve for time by setting the two equations equal to each other: \n\nx/Q's rate = (43-x)/(1.15Q's rate) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx = 21.5 \n\nThis means that Friend Q walks 21.5 km before they meet. \n\nTo find out how far Friend P walks, we can substitute x into the equation we set up earlier: \n\n43 - x = 43 - 21.5 = 21.5 \n\nTherefore, Friend P walks 21.5 km before they meet. \n\nThe answer is (B) 21.5 km.",
