            "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks before they meet \"x\". This means that Friend P walks the remaining distance of 43-x. \n\nSince Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, we can set up the equation:\n\nSpeed of Friend Q = x/time = d/t\nSpeed of Friend P = 1.15(x)/(time) = (43-x)/(time)\n\nWe can set these two equations equal to each other, since they will meet at the same time:\n\nx/time = (43-x)/(time*1.15)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1.15x = 43 - x\n2.15x = 43\nx = 20\n\nSo Friend Q walks 20 km before they meet, and Friend P walks the remaining 23 km.
