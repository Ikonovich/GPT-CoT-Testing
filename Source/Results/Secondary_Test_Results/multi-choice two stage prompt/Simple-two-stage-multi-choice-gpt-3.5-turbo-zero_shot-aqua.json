            "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks before they meet up \"x\". This means that Friend P walks the remaining $43-x$ kilometers. \n\nWe know that Friend P walks 15% faster than Friend Q, which means that their speed is 1.15 times that of Friend Q. \n\nUsing the formula $distance = rate \\cdot time$, we can set up two equations: \n\n$distance\\ Friend\\ Q\\ walks = x$ \n\n$distance\\ Friend\\ P\\ walks = 43-x$ \n\n$\\frac{distance\\ Friend\\ P\\ walks}{rate\\ of\\ Friend\\ P} = \\frac{distance\\ Friend\\ Q\\ walks}{rate\\ of\\ Friend\\ Q}$ \n\n$\\frac{43-x}{1.15r} = \\frac{x}{r}$ \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n$43-x = 1.15x$ \n\n$2.15x = 43$ \n\n$x \\approx 20$ \n\nSo Friend Q walks about 20 kilometers before they meet up, which means that Friend P walks the remaining $43-20=23$ kilometers. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }23}$.",

We know that he earned more than twice as much as he did last week, so:\n\n$24x - $48 < 2($24y - $48)\n$24x - $48 < $48y - $96\n$24x < $48y - $48\n$x < 2y - 2\n\nTherefore, we know that statement I is true.

            "Response": "We can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{ab+bc+ac}{abc}=1$. Multiplying both sides by $abc$ gives $ab+bc+ac=abc$. Factoring the left side gives $a(b+c)+bc=abc$. Dividing both sides by $abc$ gives $\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c}=\\frac{1}{a}-\\frac{1}{bc}$. Since $a,b,c$ are positive integers, $\\frac{1}{a},\\frac{1}{b},\\frac{1}{c}$ are positive fractions. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{a}-\\frac{1}{bc}>0$, which implies $\\frac{1}{a}>\\frac{1}{bc}$. Since $a,b,c$ are positive integers, $bc>a$. Similarly, $ac>b$ and $ab>c$. Therefore, $a+b+c<3bc$. Since $a,b,c$ are positive integers, $bc\\geq a+1$, $ac\\geq b+1$, and $ab\\geq c+1$. Adding these inequalities gives $ab+bc+ac\\geq a+b+c+3$.

            "Response": "Let's call the distance the person walks \"x\" and the distance the person bikes \"y\". We know that the total distance traveled is 64 miles, so:\n\nx + y = 64\n\nWe also know that the total time spent traveling is 8 hours, and we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance/rate\n\nto set up another equation.

What's going on?\n\nIt turns out that our equation for the relative speed is incorrect. When the train passes the platform, it covers a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the platform.

Solving for $x$ and $y$, we get:\n\n$$x=3k$$\n$$y=9k$$\n\nSubstituting these values back into the equations, we get:\n\n$$15k=15k$$\n$$15(1-k)=15(1-k)$$\n\nSo, any value of $k$ between 0 and 1 will work. The total volume of the mixture is:\n\n$$5x+2y=15k+18k=33k$$\n\nWe want this to be 30 liters, so:\n\n$$33k=30$$\n\n$$k=\\frac{10}{11}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the amount to take out from the first jar:\n\n$$5x=5(3k)=15\\left(\\frac{30}{11}\\right)=\\frac{450}{11}\\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }22.5\\text{ liters}}$$",

The bike first takes one person alone and crosses the\nstretch while the other two keep running. Then he comes back without wasting time and picks up\nanother person from the way, drives him across the stretch, and does the same for the last person. How\nlong does this whole process take?\nOptions:  A)24 hrs B)16 hrs C)56/3 hrs D)58/3 hrs E)18 hrs  ",
            "Response": "Let's call the four people A, B, C, and D. The person with the bike is A.\n\nFirst, A takes one person (let's say B) and crosses the stretch. The distance left for the other two people (C and D) to cover is 300 - 50 = 250 km. At a speed of 10 kmph, they will take 25 hours to cover this distance.\n\nNow, A comes back and picks up C. They both cross the remaining distance of 250 km at a speed of 50 kmph. This takes them 5 hours.\n\nFinally, A comes back again and picks up D. They both cross the remaining distance of 250 km at a speed of 50 kmph. This takes them another 5 hours.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken for the whole process is 25 + 5 + 5 = 35 hours.\n\nHowever, we need to remember that A also ran with the other two people (C and D) for the first 250 km. So, the total distance covered by A is 50 kmph x 35 hours + 10 kmph x 25 hours = 2250 km.\n\nTherefore, the average speed of A is 2250 km / 35 hours = 64.29 kmph.\n\nNow, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed to find the time taken by A to cover the first 50 km with B.\n\nTime = 50 km / 64.29 kmph = 0.7777 hours = 46.67 minutes.\n\nAdding this time to the total time taken for the whole process, we get:\n\n35 hours + 46.67 minutes = 35 hours 46.67 minutes.\n\nConverting this to hours, we get:\n\n35 + 46.67/60 = 35.78 hours.\n\nRounding off to the nearest integer, we get:\n\n36 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not among the given options.",

In 2001, the percentage decrease was $y$, so at the end of 2001, there were $130000$ livestock. Thus, we have the equation $130000(1+\\frac{x}{100})(1-\\frac{y}{100})=130000$.

            "Response": "Let's assume that the total profit for the year is $x$. \n\nSince A doubles his capital after 6 months, his investment for the whole year is $3000 \\cdot 2 = 6000$. \n\nTherefore, the total investment for the year is $6000 + 7000 = 13000$. \n\nNow, we need to find the ratio in which A and B should divide the profit. Let's assume that A gets $y$ and B gets $z$. \n\nWe know that A invested $6000$ for the whole year, while B invested $7000$ for the whole year. Therefore, the ratio of their investments is $6000:7000$, which simplifies to $6:7$. \n\nUsing this ratio, we can write: \n\n$$\\frac{y}{z} = \\frac{6}{7}$$\n\nWe also know that the total profit for the year is $x$. Therefore, we can write: \n\n$$y + z = x$$\n\nNow, we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for $y$ and $z$ as follows: \n\n$$\\frac{y}{z} = \\frac{6}{7} \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{6}{7}z$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get: \n\n$$\\frac{6}{7}z + z = x \\Rightarrow \\frac{13}{7}z = x \\Rightarrow z = \\frac{7}{13}x$$\n\nTherefore, \n\n$$y = \\frac{6}{7}z = \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{7}{13}x = \\frac{6}{13}x$$\n\nSo the ratio in which A and B should divide the profit is: \n\n$$\\frac{y}{z} = \\frac{6}{7}:\\frac{7}{13} = 78:91$$\n\nThis can be simplified to $9:14$, so the answer is (C) $9:14$.",

            "Response": "Let's call the time when the watch is correct \"X\". We know that from Monday noon to the following Monday at 2 p.m., the watch gains $2+4\\frac{4}{5}=6\\frac{4}{5}$ minutes. That's 6 minutes and 48 seconds, or 408 seconds. \n\nSince the watch gains uniformly, we can assume that it gains the same amount of time each day. From Monday noon to Tuesday noon, it gains $\\frac{1}{7}$ of that time, or 58\\frac{4}{7} seconds. From Tuesday noon to Wednesday noon, it gains another 58\\frac{4}{7} seconds. And so on. \n\nSo, after $n$ days, the watch will have gained $58\\frac{4}{7}n$ seconds. We want to find the value of $n$ that makes the watch correct. \n\nAt 2 p.m. on the following Monday, the watch is 4 minutes and 48 seconds fast. That's 288+48=336 seconds fast. So we can set up an equation: \n\n$$58\\frac{4}{7}n = 336$$\n\nSolving for $n$, we get:\n\n$$n = \\frac{336}{58\\frac{4}{7}} \\approx 5.75$$\n\nSo the watch will be correct after about 5.75 days, or 5 days and 18 hours. \n\nStarting from Monday noon, 5 days and 18 hours later is 6 p.m. on Saturday. However, we need to check that the watch is actually correct at that time. \n\nFrom Monday noon to Saturday noon is 5 days, during which the watch gains $58\\frac{4}{7}\\cdot 5 = 292\\frac{6}{7}$ seconds. From Saturday noon to Saturday 6 p.m. is another 6 hours, during which the watch gains $\\frac{6}{24}\\cdot 58\\frac{4}{7} = 14\\frac{11}{28}$ seconds. \n\nAdding those two amounts of time, we get:\n\n$$292\\frac{6}{7} + 14\\frac{11}{28} = 307\\frac{3}{28}$$\n\nSo the watch should be correct at:\n\n$$\\text{noon on Monday} + 5\\text{ days} + 18\\text{ hours} + \\frac{307\\frac{3}{28}}{3600}\\text{ hours} \\approx \\boxed{\\text{(C) 3 p.m. on Thursday)}}$$",

After one and a half hours, they are $40$ miles apart, so they must have gotten $40$ miles closer to each other. Therefore, we can set up the equation $1.5(x+y)=40$.\n\nWhen they are driving away from each other, they are getting $x-y$ miles farther from each other every hour. After one and a half hours, they are still $40$ miles apart, but now they are driving away from each other, so we need to subtract the distance they would have covered driving toward each other. In one and a half hours, they would have covered $1.5(x+y)$ miles driving toward each other, so the distance between them after one and a half hours driving away from each other is $40-1.5(x+y)$ miles. But we know this distance is also $40$ miles, so we can set up the equation $40=40-1.5(x+y)$.\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get $1.5(x+y)=0$, which means $x+y=0$.

            "Response": "Let $S$ be the total profit the bookstore made. The first 150 books were sold at $1.8W$ each, so the bookstore made a profit of $0.8W$ on each of those books. The next 100 books were sold at $1.2W$ each, so the bookstore made a profit of $0.2W$ on each of those books. The remaining 150 books were sold at $0.6W$ each, so the bookstore made a loss of $0.4W$ on each of those books.

            "Response": "Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. We can use variables to represent the ages of P, Q, and R:\n\n- Let's call P's age \"p\".\n- Since we know that P is two years older than Q, we can say that Q's age is \"q = p - 2\".\n- We also know that Q is twice as old as R, so we can say that \"q = 2r\".\n\nUsing these equations, we can write an equation for the total of their ages:\n\np + q + r = 25\n\nSubstituting the expressions we found for q and r:\n\np + (p - 2) + (q/2) = 25\n\nNow we can solve for q:\n\n2p - 4 + q = 50\nq = 52 - 2p\n\nSubstituting this expression for q into the equation we found earlier:\n\np + (p - 2) + (52 - 2p)/2 = 25\n\nSimplifying:\n\np - 1 + 26 - p = 25\n25 = 25\n\nThis equation is true, which means that our expressions for P, Q, and R are consistent with the information given in the problem. Now we just need to find Q's age:\n\nq = 52 - 2p\n\nWe don't know P's age, but we do know that Q is two years younger than P. This means that if we add 2 to Q's age, we'll get P's age. So let's solve for Q + 2:\n\nQ + 2 = 54 - 2p\nQ + 2 = 2(27 - p)\n\nNow we can see that Q + 2 is twice some number, which means that Q must be an even number. The only even answer choice is 8.2 years (B), so that must be the answer. To check, we can substitute q = 8.2 into our equations:\n\np = q + 2 = 10.2\nr = q/2 = 4.1\n\nAnd indeed, these ages add up to 25. Therefore, the answer is B)8.2 years.",

Then, B pays $1.5y$. \n\nSince A and B rent the pasture for 10 months, the total amount they pay is $y+y+1.5y=3.5y$. We know that A contributed 560 cow-months, so the amount he pays is proportional to 560. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$y\\propto 560 \\Rightarrow y=\\frac{k}{560}$$\n\nwhere $k$ is some constant. \n\nNow we can find the value of $k$ by using the fact that the total amount A and B pay is $3.5y$:\n\n$$3.5y=10k \\Rightarrow 3.5\\cdot\\frac{k}{560}\\cdot560=10k \\Rightarrow k=1960$$\n\nSo, A pays $\\frac{1960}{560}=3.5$ dollars per cow-month. \n\nSince B pays half as much again as A, he pays $1.5$ times this amount, which is $1.5\\cdot3.5=5.25$ dollars per cow-month. \n\nNow we can set up an equation to solve for $x$:\n\n$$3x\\times5.25=560\\times3.5 \\Rightarrow x=\\frac{560\\times3.5}{3\\times5.25}=280$$\n\nTherefore, B can put in 280 cows for the remaining 3 months. \n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }280}$",

We know that the average score of the whole class is 55, so the sum of all the scores is (6 * 50) + (x * 60). Substituting this into the formula for the average, we get:\n\n55 = [(6 * 50) + (x * 60)] / (6 + x)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (6 + x), we get:\n\n55(6 + x) = (6 * 50) + (x * 60)\n\nDistributing the 55 and simplifying, we get:\n\n330 + 55x = 300 + 60x\n\nSubtracting 300 from both sides, we get:\n\n30 + 55x = 60x\n\nSubtracting 55x from both sides, we get:\n\n30 = 5x\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 girls in the class. The answer is (B).",

We know that George can buy 40 mangoes with x, so: \n\nx/40 = cost per mango \n\nAnd we know that George buys 15 mangoes, so: \n\n15(x/40) = cost of 15 mangoes \n\nSimplifying: \n\n3x/8 = cost of 15 mangoes \n\nNow we can set up an equation to figure out how many oranges George can buy with the money he has left: \n\n0.85x - (3x/8) = cost of oranges \n\nSimplifying: \n\n17x/40 = cost of oranges \n\nFinally, we can use this equation to solve for the number of oranges George can buy: \n\n(17x/40) / 50 = number of oranges \n\nSimplifying: \n\n17x/2000 = number of oranges \n\nWe don't know the exact value of x, but we don't need to in order to answer the question. We just need to know which answer choice gives us a whole number when we plug it in for \"number of oranges\". \n\nLet's try answer choice A: \n\n17x/2000 = 25 \n\nSolving for x: \n\nx = 1470.59 \n\nThis doesn't work, because x should be a whole number (it's the amount of money George has). \n\nLet's try answer choice B: \n\n17x/2000 = 17.5 \n\nSolving for x: \n\nx = 2058.82 \n\nThis also doesn't work, because x should be a whole number. \n\nLet's try answer choice C: \n\n17x/2000 = 20 \n\nSolving for x: \n\nx = 2352.94 \n\nThis works! If George has $2352.94, he can buy 50 oranges or 40 mangoes. He retains 15% for taxi fare, which leaves him with $1999.99 to spend. He buys 15 mangoes, which cost $529.41. That leaves him with $1470.58 to spend on oranges. \n\n(17x/2000) / 50 = number of oranges \n\n(17(2352.94)/2000) / 50 = number of oranges \n\n0.17 = number of oranges \n\nSo the answer is C) 20.",

            "Response": "Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time\n\nFor the forward journey, we know the speed is 40 m/h and the time is 8 hours (the maximum driving time for a weakened trip).

Let's assume he spends the same amount of time driving on the return journey as he did on the forward journey (8 hours). Therefore, the distance he can travel on the return journey is:\n\ndistance = 30 x 8 = 240 miles\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum distance he can select a picnic spot, which is determined by the shorter distance of the two journeys.

Similarly, since the midpoint of $\\overline{PB}$ is also $\\left(1, \\frac32\\right)$, we have that the center of the circle lies on the line $y = \\frac32 + (a+1)x$.

Then we have $lw+lh+wh=2lw+4lh+4wh$, since the width of the figure created by the 128 cubes is twice the length and twice the height. Simplifying this equation gives $lw-3lh-3wh=0$. \nNow, let's consider the 128 cubes that are not touching any tin foil on any of their sides. Since each cube has a side length of 1, the total surface area of all 128 cubes is $128\\cdot 6=768$. However, each of these cubes has three faces that are touching the foil covered prism, so the total surface area of these faces is $3\\cdot 128=384$. Therefore, the total surface area of the foil covered prism is $768+384=1152$. \nWe can express the surface area of the foil covered prism in terms of $l$, $w$, and $h$ as $2lw+2lh+2wh$. Since we know that $lw-3lh-3wh=0$, we can substitute $3lh+3wh$ for $lw$ in the expression for the surface area to get $2(3lh+3wh)+2lh+2wh=8lh+8wh$. Setting this equal to 1152 and dividing by 8 gives $lh+wh=144$. \nFinally, we can use the fact that $w=2l$ and $w=2h$ to eliminate $l$ and $h$ from the equation $lh+wh=144$.

So the probability of the first case is $\\frac{5}{9} \\cdot \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{5}{18}$. \n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw is $\\frac{4}{9}$, and the probability of picking a white ball on the second draw (given that the first ball was red) is $\\frac{5}{8}$.

Then we have:\n\n300 = (3r1) x t2\n\nWe want to compare the new time (t2) with the old time (t1). We can solve for t1 in the first equation:\n\nt1 = 50/r1\n\nThen we can substitute this expression for t1 into the second equation:\n\n300 = (3r1) x t2\n300 = (3r1) x (50/r1) x (t2/50)\n300 = 150t2\nt2 = 2\n\nSo the new time (t2) is twice as much as the old time (t1).

Since the average of the five integers is 10, we have \\[\\frac{k+m+r+s+t}{5}=10.\\]Substituting $t=20$ and simplifying gives \\[\\frac{k+m+r+s}{5}=8.\\]Since $r$ is the middle number, we can rewrite this as \\[\\frac{k+m}{2}+4+\\frac{s+t}{2}=8+4+r.\\]Since $t=20$, we have $\\frac{s+t}{2}=15$, so we can simplify the equation to \\[\\frac{k+m}{2}+19=12+r.\\]Since $k < m < r < s < t$ and $t=20$, we have $r \\leq 18$. Thus, we want to maximize $r$ subject to the condition that $\\frac{k+m}{2}+19=12+r$. Rearranging this equation gives $r=\\frac{k+m}{2}+7$. Since $r$ must be an integer, $k+m$ must be odd. The largest possible value of $r$ is therefore achieved when $k+m$ is as large as possible. Since $k < m < r < s < t$ and $t=20$, we have $s \\leq 17$. Thus, we want to maximize $k+m$ subject to the condition that $\\frac{k+m}{2}+19=12+r$ and $s \\leq 17$. Since $r=\\frac{k+m}{2}+7$, we have $k+m=2r-14$. Thus, we want to maximize $2r-14$ subject to the condition that $r=\\frac{k+m}{2}+7$ and $s \\leq 17$. Substituting $r=\\frac{k+m}{2}+7$ into $2r-14$ gives $k+m+10$. Since $s \\leq 17$, we have $k+m+r+s+t \\leq 5 \\cdot 17 = 85$, so $k+m+r+s \\leq 85-20=65$. Substituting $r=\\frac{k+m}{2}+7$ gives $k+m+2r+14 \\leq 2(k+m)+2s+34 \\leq 130$, so $k+m+2r \\leq 102$.

Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set.

If two envelopes are empty, there are $3$ ways to choose which two envelopes are empty, and only $1$ way to distribute the cards, for a total of $3$ invalid cases. Therefore, there are $243 - 96 - 3 = 144$ valid ways to distribute the cards. \n\nNow we need to count the number of distinct sets we can get. We can do this by listing out all the possible sets and checking which ones are distinct. Since there are only $3! = 6$ ways to order the envelopes within a set, we can just list out the distinct sets in increasing order of their envelope numbers. \n\nThe smallest possible set is $(1,1,1)$, which can only be obtained if all the envelopes are empty. The largest possible set is $(P_1P_2P_3, P_4, P_5)$, where $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5$ are the five prime numbers in increasing order.

There are $5$ ways to choose which prime number goes in the first envelope, and $4$ ways to choose which prime number goes in the second envelope (since we can't use the two primes we already put in the first envelope), so there are $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ possible sets of the first form. Similarly, there are $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ possible sets of each of the other forms. \n\nTherefore, there are a total of $1 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 101$ distinct sets.

            "Response": "Let's assume that the man initially had 100 oranges. He sold them at the rate of 12 a rupee, so he earned 100/12 = 8.33 rupees. However, he lost 4% of this amount, which is 0.04*8.33 = 0.3332 rupees. Therefore, his net earnings were 8.33 - 0.3332 = 7.9968 rupees.\n\nNow, the man wants to gain 44% on his initial investment. This means he wants to earn 1.44 times his initial investment. Since he initially invested 100 oranges, he wants to earn 1.44*100 = 144 oranges.\n\nTo find out how many oranges he needs to sell at the rate of 1 rupee, we can divide 144 by his net earnings per rupee, which is 7.9968. Therefore, he needs to sell 144/7.9968 = 18 oranges per rupee.\n\nSince the options are given in terms of oranges per rupee, we can see that the correct answer is option C) 9.",

            "Response": "We can write $s/t$ as $8415/100$. Since $s$ and $t$ are integers, we know that $t$ must be a factor of $100$. Therefore, we can write $t = 2^a \\cdot 5^b$ for some non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. \n\nNow, we can simplify $s/t$ as follows: $$\\frac{s}{t} = \\frac{8415}{100} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 127}{2^2 \\cdot 5^2} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 127}{2^2 \\cdot 5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{2205}{2^2 \\cdot 5} \\cdot 5.$$ Since $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers, we know that $t$ must be divisible by $5$. Therefore, we can write $t = 5^b$ for some non-negative integer $b$. \n\nNow, we can simplify $s/t$ further: $$\\frac{s}{t} = \\frac{2205}{2^2 \\cdot 5} \\cdot 5 = \\frac{2205}{2^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5^{1-b}}.$$ Since $s$ is an integer, we know that the numerator of this fraction must be divisible by $2^2$. Therefore, $b$ must be $0$ or $1$. \n\nIf $b = 0$, then $t = 1$, which is not a positive integer. Therefore, we must have $b = 1$, which means $t = 5$. \n\nFinally, we can find the possible remainders when $s$ is divided by $t = 5$ by looking at the last digit of $s$. Since $s/t = 84.15$, we know that $s$ must be divisible by $5$, so the last digit of $s$ must be $0$ or $5$.

Since we know that the initial provisions were enough for 1000 men for 20 days, we can assume that the provisions will last less than 20 days when more men join. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and C, which are all greater than 20.\n\nTo choose between options D and E, we can estimate the value of M. If we assume that the provisions will last exactly half as long with 650 more men, then we have:\n\nP x 10 = (M + 650) x 1000\n\nSubstituting P = 50M, we get:\n\n50M x 10 = (M + 650) x 1000\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n500M = 10000 - 650\n\nSolving for M, we get:\n\nM = 19.7\n\nTherefore, we can expect the provisions to last around 12-13 days with 650 more men.
