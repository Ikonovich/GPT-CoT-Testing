The problem states that in four years, the father's age will be double the sum of the ages of his sons, so we can write the equation:\n\n3(x+y)+4 = 2[(x+4)+(y+4)]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3x+3y+4 = 2x+2y+16\n\nSubtracting 2x and 2y from both sides, we get:\n\nx+y = 12\n\nSince the father's present age is 3(x+y), we can substitute the value we found for x+y:\n\nFather's present age = 3(12) = 36\n\nSo the father's present age is 36 years.

            "Response": "Let the diagonals of the rhombus be d1 and d2. We are given that one of the diagonals is 30 cm, so d1 = 30 cm. We need to find the length of the other diagonal, d2.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. Let's consider one of these right triangles. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is a side of the rhombus, which is 25 cm. One of the legs of this right triangle is half of the given diagonal, which is 15 cm (since d1 = 30 cm).\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg of this right triangle:\n\n25^2 = 15^2 + x^2\n625 = 225 + x^2\nx^2 = 400\nx = 20\n\nSo, the length of the other leg of the right triangle is 20 cm. This means that half of the other diagonal (d2) is 20 cm. Therefore, the length of the other diagonal (d2) is 40 cm.\n\nNow, we can find the area of the rhombus using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * d1 * d2\nArea = (1/2) * 30 * 40\nArea = 15 * 40\nArea = 600\n\nSo, the area of the rhombus is 600 square centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is {600}.",

Let this number of days be x.\n\nSo, (5W + 4M) * x = 15W * 55 (since the total work done remains the same)\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 15W from the first equation:\n\n(5W + 4M) * x = 10M * 55\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\n(W + 0.8M) * x = 2M * 55\n\nNow, substituting the value of W from the first equation:\n\n(10M/15 + 0.8M) * x = 2M * 55\n\nDividing both sides by M, we get:\n\n(10/15 + 0.8) * x = 2 * 55\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n(2/3 + 0.8) * x = 110\n\n(2/3 + 4/5) * x = 110\n\n(10 + 12) / 15 * x = 110\n\n22/15 * x = 110\n\nNow, multiplying both sides by 15/22, we get:\n\nx = 110 * 15/22\n\nx = 75\n\nSo, 5 women and 4 men working together can complete the project in 75 days.\n\nThe final answer is {75}.",

If science books are removed randomly from the supply room, how many must be removed to ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science?\nOptions:  A)81 B)59 C)166 D)285 E)334 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide only the answer.. ",
            "Response": "To ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science, we need to consider the worst-case scenario, which is that we remove 79 books from each of the other sciences before removing 80 books from the desired science. So, we need to remove 79 books from botany, 79 books from zoology, 79 books from physics, and 79 books from geology, and then 80 books from chemistry. \n\n79 + 79 + 79 + 79 + 80 = 396\n\nSo, we need to remove 396 books to ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. \n\nLet's reconsider the problem. We want to ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science. To do this, we can remove 79 books from each of the sciences with the most books (physics and chemistry), and then remove one more book. This will guarantee that we have removed 80 books from one of these sciences. \n\n79 + 79 + 1 = 159\n\nSo, we need to remove 159 books to ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science.

We want to ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science. To do this, we can remove 49 books from botany, 74 books from zoology, 49 books from geology, and 79 books from physics. This will leave us with only chemistry books. Then, we can remove one more book, which will be a chemistry book, ensuring that we have removed 80 chemistry books. \n\n49 + 74 + 49 + 79 + 1 = 252\n\nSo, we need to remove 252 books to ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science.
