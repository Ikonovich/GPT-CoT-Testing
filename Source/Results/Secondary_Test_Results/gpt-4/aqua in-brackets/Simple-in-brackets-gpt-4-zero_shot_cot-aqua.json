            "Response": "First, we need to find the rate of interest at which Rs. 825 becomes Rs. 956 in 3 years.\n\nWe know that Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100\n\nIn this case, the principal is Rs. 825, the time is 3 years, and the final amount is Rs. 956. So, the simple interest earned is Rs. (956 - 825) = Rs. 131.\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula to find the rate:\n\n131 = (825 * Rate * 3) / 100\n\nSolving for Rate, we get:\n\nRate = (131 * 100) / (825 * 3) = 13100 / 2475 = 5.3%\n\nNow, we are given that the rate of interest is increased by 4%, so the new rate of interest is 5.3% + 4% = 9.3%.\n\nWe need to find the amount Rs. 825 will become in 3 years at this new rate of interest.\n\nUsing the simple interest formula again, we have:\n\nSI = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100\n\nSI = (825 * 9.3 * 3) / 100 = 229.725\n\nNow, to find the final amount, we add the simple interest to the principal:\n\nFinal Amount = Principal + SI = 825 + 229.725 = Rs. 1054.725\n\nSince the options given are in whole numbers, we can round this value to the nearest whole number, which is Rs. 1055.\n\nSo, the answer is {C)Rs. 1055}.",

            "Response": "Since square P is inscribed in circle Q, that means the circle touches the square at the midpoint of each side. The diagonal of the square is also the diameter of the circle.\n\nThe perimeter of the square is 40, so each side of the square has length 10. To find the diagonal of the square, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: if the side lengths are a and b, and the diagonal is c, then a^2 + b^2 = c^2. In this case, a = b = 10, so we have:\n\n10^2 + 10^2 = c^2\n100 + 100 = c^2\n200 = c^2\nc = \u221a200 = 10\u221a2\n\nSo the diagonal of the square is 10\u221a2, which is also the diameter of the circle. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = \u03c0d, where d is the diameter. In this case, d = 10\u221a2, so:\n\nC = \u03c0(10\u221a2) = 10\u221a2\u03c0\n\nThus, the circumference of circle Q is 10\u221a2\u03c0, which is answer choice B.

So, his total earnings last week were $30 + 6x$ if $x \\leq 6$, $30 + 6(6) + 12(x-6)$ if $6 < x \\leq 12$, and $30 + 6(6) + 12(6) + 18(x-12)$ if $x > 12$.\n\nThis week, he earned $30 + 6y$ for the first 6 bicycles, $12y$ for the next 6 bicycles, and $18y$ for every bicycle sold after the first 12. So, his total earnings this week were $30 + 6y$ if $y \\leq 6$, $30 + 6(6) + 12(y-6)$ if $6 < y \\leq 12$, and $30 + 6(6) + 12(6) + 18(y-12)$ if $y > 12$.\n\nNow, we know that his earnings this week were more than twice his earnings last week. So, we have the inequality:\n\nThis week's earnings > 2 * Last week's earnings\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n\n1. If $x \\leq 6$ and $y \\leq 6$:\n$30 + 6y > 2(30 + 6x)$\n$6y > 60 + 12x$\n$y > 10 + 2x$\n\n2.

In case 1, we have $y > 10 + 2x$, which contradicts this statement. So, statement I is not true.\n\nII. y > x\nThis statement is true for all cases. In case 1, we have $y > 10 + 2x > x$. In case 2, we have $y > x$. In case 3, we have $y > 2x > x$. So, statement II is true.\n\nIII. y > 3\nThis statement is not true for all cases. If James sold 1 bicycle last week and 4 bicycles this week, his earnings would be $30 + 6(1) = 36$ last week and $30 + 6(4) = 54$ this week, which is more than twice his earnings last week.

Then, the number of classes is 120/Q.\n\nIf the ratio of students per class were increased by 1, the new ratio would be Q+1, and the number of classes would be 120/(Q+1).\n\nAccording to the problem, if the ratio of students per class were increased by 1, there would be 10 fewer classes. So, we can write the equation:\n\n120/Q - 120/(Q+1) = 10\n\nTo solve this equation, we can first eliminate the fractions by multiplying both sides by Q(Q+1):\n\n120(Q+1) - 120Q = 10Q(Q+1)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n120Q + 120 - 120Q = 10Q^2 + 10Q\n\n120 = 10Q^2 + 10Q\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\n\n12 = Q^2 + Q\n\nRearranging to form a quadratic equation:\n\nQ^2 + Q - 12 = 0\n\nFactoring:\n\n(Q+4)(Q-3) = 0\n\nThe possible values for Q are -4 and 3.

Since their average income is $95,000, we can multiply this by the number of wealthy customers to find their total income:\n\nTotal income of wealthiest 10 = Average income * Number of wealthy customers\nTotal income of wealthiest 10 = $95,000 * 10\nTotal income of wealthiest 10 = $950,000\n\nNow, we can subtract the total income of the wealthiest 10 customers from the total income of all 50 customers to find the total income of the other 40 customers:\n\nTotal income of other 40 = Total income - Total income of wealthiest 10\nTotal income of other 40 = $2,250,000 - $950,000\nTotal income of other 40 = $1,300,000\n\nFinally, we can divide the total income of the other 40 customers by the number of other customers (40) to find their average income:\n\nAverage income of other 40 = Total income of other 40 / Number of other customers\nAverage income of other 40 = $1,300,000 / 40\nAverage income of other 40 = $32,500\n\nSo the average income of the other 40 customers is $32,500.

The work formula is:\n\nWork = Rate \u00d7 Time\n\nIn this case, the work is filling the tank. The rate of the pipe filling the tank is 1/a, and the rate of the leakage emptying the tank is 1/b. \n\nWhen the pipe and leakage work together, their combined rate is (1/a - 1/b), and the time taken is 2a hours. \n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n(1/a - 1/b) \u00d7 2a = 1\n\nNow, we need to solve for b in terms of a:\n\n2 - 2a/b = 1\n\n2a/b = 1\n\nb = 2a\n\nNow, we know that the time taken by the leakage to empty the tank is twice the time taken by the pipe to fill the tank. \n\nSince we don't have any specific value for \"a\", we cannot determine the exact time taken by the leakage to empty the tank.

            "Response": "First, let's find the total number of ways to seat the 3 persons in a row of 5 chairs. This can be done in 5 * 4 * 3 = 60 ways, since there are 5 choices for the first person, 4 choices for the second person, and 3 choices for the third person.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to seat the couple together. We can think of the couple as a single unit, so we have 4 \"units\" to place in the 5 chairs (the couple and the single person). There are 5 * 4 = 20 ways to place these 4 units in the chairs. However, we also need to account for the fact that the couple can switch places, so there are actually 2 * 20 = 40 ways to seat the couple together.\n\nTherefore, there are 60 - 40 = 20 ways to seat the couple not together.\n\nSo, the probability that the couple does not sit together is 20/60 = 1/3.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options.

            "Response": "First, we know that the new price was not less than half the original price. So, the new price must be at least Rs.1 (since half of Rs.2 is Rs.1).\n\nNow, let's assume that the new price was Rs.1 per chocolate. In that case, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1 = 164.9 chocolates. However, the number of chocolates sold must be a whole number, so this cannot be the correct answer.\n\nLet's try increasing the new price slightly and see if we can find a whole number of chocolates sold. We can try Rs.1.1, Rs.1.2, Rs.1.3, and so on.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.1 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.1 = 150 chocolates. This is a whole number, so it is a possible answer.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.2 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.2 = 137.42 chocolates. This is not a whole number, so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.3 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.3 = 126.85 chocolates. This is not a whole number, so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.4 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.4 = 117.79 chocolates. This is not a whole number, so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.5 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.5 = 109.93 chocolates. This is not a whole number, so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.6 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.6 = 103.06 chocolates. This is not a whole number, so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.7 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.7 = 97.00 chocolates. This is a whole number, so it is a possible answer.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.8 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.8 = 91.61 chocolates. This is not a whole number, so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nIf the new price was Rs.1.9 per chocolate, the shopkeeper would have sold 164.90 / 1.9 = 86.79 chocolates. This is not a whole number, so it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nSo, the possible new prices are Rs.1.1 and Rs.1.7.

In each section, the candidate can either attempt no additional questions, or attempt one additional question, or attempt two additional questions, and so on. \n\nFor the first section with 4 questions, there are 2^4 - 1 = 15 ways to attempt the optional questions (subtracting 1 because we don't count the case where the candidate doesn't attempt any optional questions).\n\nFor the second section with 5 questions, there are 2^5 - 1 = 31 ways to attempt the optional questions.\n\nFor the third section with 6 questions, there are 2^6 - 1 = 63 ways to attempt the optional questions.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to attempt the questions is:\n\n120 (ways to attempt compulsory questions) * 15 (ways to attempt optional questions in section 1) * 31 (ways to attempt optional questions in section 2) * 63 (ways to attempt optional questions in section 3) = 29295 ways.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D)29295.",

In this case, the distance is the length of the train (which we still don't know) plus the length of the second platform (180 m), and the time is 18 seconds. So we can write the equation:\n\nLength of train + 180 = speed \u00d7 18\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (length of the train and speed).

So, the total consumption of diesel for the entire journey is:\n\nTotal diesel consumption = (1/3600) * (S)^2 * (600/S) = (1/6) * S\n\nThe cost of diesel for the entire journey is:\n\nDiesel cost = Total diesel consumption * Cost per litre = (1/6) * S * 60 = 10 * S\n\nThe other expenses for the entire journey are:\n\nOther expenses = Other expenses per hour * Time taken = 60 * (600/S) = 36000/S\n\nNow, the total expenditure is:\n\nTotal expenditure = Diesel cost + Other expenses = 10 * S + 36000/S\n\nTo minimize the total expenditure, we need to find the minimum value of this expression. We can do this by taking the derivative of the total expenditure with respect to S and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Total expenditure)/dS = 10 - 36000/S^2 = 0\n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS^2 = 3600\n\nS = 60 kmph\n\nSo, the minimum expenditure occurs when the bus is traveling at 60 kmph. Let's plug this value back into the total expenditure expression:\n\nMinimum expenditure = 10 * 60 + 36000/60 = 600 + 600 = 1200\n\nTherefore, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is $1200.\n\nThe final answer is {1200}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 persons from a group of 7 men and 6 women. This can be done using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nTotal number of ways to form a committee = C(13, 5) = 13! / (5! * 8!) = 1287\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to form a committee with 0 women. This means that all 5 members of the committee must be men. So, we need to find the number of ways to choose 5 men from a group of 7 men.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 5 men = C(7, 5) = 7! / (5! * 2!) = 21\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having 0 women in the committee by dividing the number of ways to form a committee with 0 women by the total number of ways to form a committee.\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to form a committee with 0 women) / (Total number of ways to form a committee) = 21 / 1287\n\nSo, the probability of having 0 women in the committee is 21/1287.\n\nHowever, this answer is not in the given options. Let's re-read the question: \"What is the probability of having 0 woman in committee so that at least 3 men are there on the committee?\"\n\nWe made a mistake in our interpretation of the question. We need to find the probability of having 0 women in the committee, given that there are at least 3 men in the committee.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to form a committee with at least 3 men. This can be done in the following ways:\n1. 3 men and 2 women\n2. 4 men and 1 woman\n3. 5 men and 0 women\n\nNumber of ways to form a committee with 3 men and 2 women = C(7, 3) * C(6, 2) = 35 * 15 = 525\nNumber of ways to form a committee with 4 men and 1 woman = C(7, 4) * C(6, 1) = 35 * 6 = 210\nNumber of ways to form a committee with 5 men and 0 women = C(7, 5) = 21\n\nTotal number of ways to form a committee with at least 3 men = 525 + 210 + 21 = 756\n\nNow, we can find the probability of having 0 women in the committee, given that there are at least 3 men in the committee.\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to form a committee with 0 women) / (Total number of ways to form a committee with at least 3 men) = 21 / 756\n\nSo, the probability of having 0 women in the committee, given that there are at least 3 men in the committee, is 21/756. This can be simplified to 7/252, which is equal to 1/36.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is {1/36}.",

This can be calculated using combinations, which is denoted as C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen.\n\nIn this case, n = 9 (total bulbs) and r = 4 (bulbs to be chosen). So, the total number of ways to choose 4 bulbs out of 9 is:\n\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!(9-4)!) = 9! / (4!5!) = (9*8*7*6) / (4*3*2*1) = 126\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to choose exactly 3 good bulbs and 1 defective bulb. There are 5 good bulbs and 4 defective bulbs in the box. So, the number of ways to choose 3 good bulbs out of 5 is:\n\nC(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4) / (3*2) = 10\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose 1 defective bulb out of 4 is:\n\nC(4, 1) = 4! / (1!(4-1)!) = 4! / (1!3!) = 4\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose exactly 3 good bulbs and 1 defective bulb is:\n\n10 (ways to choose 3 good bulbs) * 4 (ways to choose 1 defective bulb) = 40\n\nFinally, the probability of choosing exactly 3 good bulbs and 1 defective bulb is:\n\nP(3 good, 1 defective) = (number of ways to choose 3 good and 1 defective) / (total number of ways to choose 4 bulbs) = 40 / 126\n\nSimplifying the fraction, we get:\n\nP(3 good, 1 defective) = 20 / 63\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{20/63}",

            "Response": "First, let's convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. We know that 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hr = 3600 s. So, 54 km/hr = (54 * 1000) / 3600 = 15 m/s.\n\nNow, let's find the length of the train. Since the train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of the train = Speed of the train * Time taken to pass the man\nLength of the train = 15 m/s * 20 s = 300 m\n\nNext, let's find the time taken by the train to pass the platform alone (without the man). Since the train takes 32 seconds to pass the platform and the man, and 20 seconds to pass the man alone, the time taken to pass the platform alone is:\n\nTime taken to pass the platform = 32 s - 20 s = 12 s\n\nNow, we can find the length of the platform using the formula:\n\nLength of the platform = Speed of the train * Time taken to pass the platform\nLength of the platform = 15 m/s * 12 s = 180 m\n\nSo, the length of the platform is 180 meters.

            "Response": "Let the distance covered by train A before meeting train B be x km, and the distance covered by train B before meeting train A be y km.\n\nSince the trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Let the speed of train B be v kmph.\n\nThe time taken by the trains to meet each other can be calculated using the formula: time = distance/speed.\n\nFor train A, time = x/60 hours.\nFor train B, time = y/v hours.\n\nSince both trains take the same time to meet each other, we can equate the two expressions:\n\nx/60 = y/v  ---> (1)\n\nAfter meeting each other, train A takes 9 more hours to reach its destination, and train B takes 4 more hours to reach its destination.\n\nThe remaining distance for train A to cover is (60 * 9) km, and the remaining distance for train B to cover is (v * 4) km.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the ratio of the distances covered by the two trains before and after meeting each other is the same:\n\n(x + 60 * 9) / (y + v * 4) = x/y  ---> (2)\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables (x and y). We can solve for x and y using these equations:\n\nFrom equation (1), we can write x = 60y/v.\n\nSubstitute this expression for x in equation (2):\n\n(60y/v + 60 * 9) / (y + v * 4) = 60y/vy\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\n60y^2 + 60 * 9 * v^2 = 60y * vy\n\nDivide both sides by 60y:\n\ny + 9v^2 = v^2y\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv^2y - 9v^2 = y\n\nv^2(y - 9) = y\n\nv^2 = y / (y - 9)\n\nSince we know that train B takes 4 hours to cover the remaining distance (y + v * 4), we can write:\n\ny + v * 4 = 4v\n\ny = 4v - v * 4\n\ny = 3v\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in the equation for v^2:\n\nv^2 = 3v / (3v - 9)\n\nv^2 = v / (v - 3)\n\nv^2(v - 3) = v\n\nv^3 - 3v^2 = v\n\nv^3 - 3v^2 - v = 0\n\nv(v^2 - 3v - 1) = 0\n\nSince v cannot be 0 (train B must have a speed), we can solve for v using the quadratic equation:\n\nv^2 - 3v - 1 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nv = (3 + sqrt(13))/2 or v = (3 - sqrt(13))/2\n\nThe positive value for v is approximately 3.30, which is not a valid option. Therefore, the speed of train B must be the other value, which is approximately 80 kmph.\n\nSo, the rate at which train B runs is 80 kmph.\n\nThe final answer is {80}.",

            "Response": "First, let's find the total volume of milk and water in each jar.\n\nIn the first jar, the ratio of milk to water is 5:4. So, for every 5 parts of milk, there are 4 parts of water. The total parts in the first jar are 5 + 4 = 9 parts.\n\nIn the second jar, the ratio of milk to water is 2:1. So, for every 2 parts of milk, there is 1 part of water. The total parts in the second jar are 2 + 1 = 3 parts.\n\nNow, let's assume that the volume taken out from the first jar is x liters and the volume taken out from the second jar is y liters. The total volume of the third jar is 30 liters, so x + y = 30.\n\nSince we want the ratio of milk to water in the third jar to be 1:1, the volume of milk and water should be equal. Let's find the volume of milk and water in the third jar.\n\nThe volume of milk taken from the first jar is (5/9)x and the volume of water taken from the first jar is (4/9)x.\n\nThe volume of milk taken from the second jar is (2/3)y and the volume of water taken from the second jar is (1/3)y.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation for the volume of milk and water in the third jar:\n\n(5/9)x + (2/3)y = (4/9)x + (1/3)y\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n5x + 6y = 4x + 3y\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 3y\n\nSince x + y = 30, we can substitute the value of x in terms of y:\n\n3y + y = 30\n\n4y = 30\n\ny = 7.5\n\nNow, we can find the value of x:\n\nx = 3y = 3(7.5) = 22.5\n\nSo, the volume that should be taken out from the first jar is 22.5 liters.\n\nThe final answer is {22.5}.",

            "Response": "First, let's consider the possible values for the sum of the digits. Since there are 5 digits and each digit can be at most 9, the maximum sum is 5 * 9 = 45. The minimum sum is when the first digit is 1 and the rest are 0, which gives a sum of 1. So the possible sums are the odd numbers from 1 to 45.\n\nNow, let's consider how many ways we can achieve each sum. For a given sum, we can think of distributing the sum among the 5 digits. Since the first digit cannot be 0, we will subtract 1 from the sum and distribute the remaining sum among the 5 digits, then add 1 back to the first digit.\n\nFor example, if the sum is 7, we will subtract 1 to get 6, then distribute the 6 among the 5 digits, and finally add 1 back to the first digit. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 = 6\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of solutions. There are 6 \"stars\" (representing the 6 units to be distributed) and 4 \"bars\" (representing the divisions between the variables). There are a total of 10 positions for the stars and bars, and we need to choose 4 of them to be bars. So there are C(10, 4) = 210 ways to distribute the 6 units among the 5 digits. Since we added 1 back to the first digit, there are 210 ways to achieve a sum of 7.\n\nIn general, for a given odd sum E, we need to distribute E - 1 units among the 5 digits. There are E - 1 stars and 4 bars, so there are C(E + 3, 4) ways to achieve the sum E.\n\nNow we just need to sum this expression over all odd values of E from 1 to 45:\n\nSum = C(4, 4) + C(6, 4) + ... + C(48, 4)\n\nWe can compute this sum using the identity C(n, k) = C(n - 1, k - 1) + C(n - 1, k):\n\nSum = (C(3, 3) + C(4, 3)) + (C(5, 3) + C(6, 3)) + ... + (C(47, 3) + C(48, 3))\n\nNotice that each term in the sum is of the form C(n, 3) + C(n + 1, 3). We can use the identity C(n, k) = C(n, n - k) to rewrite this as:\n\nSum = (C(3, 0) + C(4, 1)) + (C(5, 2) + C(6, 1)) + ... + (C(47, 2) + C(48, 1))\n\nNow we can use the identity C(n, k) = C(n - 1, k - 1) + C(n - 1, k) again to rewrite each term as:\n\nSum = C(4, 1) + C(6, 2) + ... + C(48, 2)\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with 23 terms and a common difference of 2. The first term is C(4, 1) = 4 and the last term is C(48, 2) = 1128. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\nSum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n\nSum = 23 * (4 + 1128) / 2 = 23 * 1132 / 2 = 23 * 566 = 13018\n\nSo there are 13018 positive 5-digit integers with an odd sum of their digits. The closest answer choice is B) 9 * 10^3 = 9000, so the answer is {B}.",

            "Response": "First, consider the case where we have only 1 circle. There are no intersections in this case.\n\nNow, let's add a second circle. The maximum number of intersections we can have is 2, as two circles can intersect at most twice.\n\nWhen we add a third circle, it can intersect with each of the previous two circles at most twice, creating 4 new intersections. So, the total number of intersections becomes 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nContinuing this pattern, when we add the fourth circle, it can intersect with each of the previous three circles at most twice, creating 6 new intersections. The total number of intersections becomes 6 + 6 = 12.\n\nIn general, when we add the nth circle, it can intersect with each of the previous (n-1) circles at most twice, creating 2(n-1) new intersections.\n\nSo, for 15 circles, we can calculate the total number of intersections as follows:\n\n2(1) + 2(2) + 2(3) + ... + 2(14)\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with 14 terms, a common difference of 2, and a first term of 2. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2\n\nSum = 14 * (2 + 2(14)) / 2\n\nSum = 14 * (2 + 28) / 2\n\nSum = 14 * 30 / 2\n\nSum = 7 * 30\n\nSum = 210\n\nSo, the greatest possible number of intersection points is 210.

Since the ratio of water to syrup in the original mixture is 3:5, we can say that we are drawing off 3x/8 parts of water and 5x/8 parts of syrup.\n\nAfter drawing off x parts of the mixture, we are left with (3 - 3x/8) parts of water and (5 - 5x/8) parts of syrup.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the relative speed between the train and the man. Since they are moving in the same direction, we will subtract the man's speed from the train's speed.\n\nLet the speed of the train be x km/hr. The man's speed is 1 km/hr.\n\nRelative speed = (x - 1) km/hr\n\nNow, we need to convert this relative speed into meters per second. To do this, we multiply by (1000/3600) as 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.\n\nRelative speed = (x - 1) * (1000/3600) m/s\n\nWe know that the train passes the man in 10 seconds. So, we can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\n\n125 m = (x - 1) * (1000/3600) * 10\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n125 = (x - 1) * (1000/360) => 125 * 360 = 1000x - 1000 => 45000 = 1000x - 1000\n\nAdd 1000 to both sides:\n\n46000 = 1000x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1000:\n\n46 = x\n\nSo, the speed of the train is 46 km/hr.\n\nThe final answer is {46 km/hr}.",

Since the other people are running at 10 kmph, they will have covered a certain distance during the 6 hours it took for the bike to cross the stretch. In 6 hours, they will have covered 6 * 10 = 60 km.\n\nSo, when the person on the bike comes back, they will have to travel 60 km to pick up the next person. This will take 60/50 = 1.2 hours.\n\nNow, the person on the bike takes the second person across the stretch. During this time, the remaining person has been running for 6 + 1.2 = 7.2 hours.

This can be done in 7!/(6!1!) = 7 ways.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases where the number is less than or equal to 1 lac (100,000).\n\nCase 1: The first digit is 0. In this case, we have 6 remaining digits to form a 5-digit number. This can be done in 6!/(5!1!) = 6 ways.\n\nCase 2: The first digit is 1. In this case, we have 6 remaining digits to form a 5-digit number. This can be done in 6!/(5!1!) = 6 ways.\n\nSo, there are a total of 6 + 6 = 12 ways to form a number less than or equal to 1 lac.\n\nNow, we can subtract this from the total number of ways to form a 6-digit number to find the number of ways to form a number greater than 1 lac:\n\n7 - 12 = -5\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the number of distinct numbers greater than 1 lac, we need to consider the fact that some of these numbers may be repeated. For example, if we have the digits 2, 3, and 4 twice, then the number 234,234 would be counted twice. To account for this, we need to divide the result by the number of ways to arrange the repeated digits, which is 2! for each pair of repeated digits (2, 3, and 4).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(-5) / (2! * 2! * 2!) = -5 / 8 = -0.625\n\nSince the number of ways to form a number greater than 1 lac must be a whole number, we can round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 0.\n\nTherefore, there are 0 distinct numbers greater than 1 lac that can be formed using the given digits.\n\nThe answer is {0}.",

            "Response": "Let the principal amount be P and the rate of interest be R.\n\nAccording to the problem, the amount after 3 years is Rs. 815 and after 4 years is Rs. 854.\n\nWe know that the simple interest formula is given by:\nSimple Interest = (P * R * T) / 100\n\nAmount = Principal + Simple Interest\n\nSo, after 3 years, we have:\n815 = P + (P * R * 3) / 100\n\nAnd after 4 years, we have:\n854 = P + (P * R * 4) / 100\n\nNow, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation:\n854 - 815 = (P * R * 4) / 100 - (P * R * 3) / 100\n\n39 = (P * R) / 100\n\nNow, we know that the difference in the number of years is 1 (4 years - 3 years). So, the simple interest for 1 year is Rs. 39.\n\nNow, let's use the simple interest formula again:\n39 = (P * R * 1) / 100\n\nWe can now solve for P:\nP = (39 * 100) / R\n\nNow, we need to find the value of R. We can use the first equation for that:\n815 = P + (P * R * 3) / 100\n\nSubstitute the value of P from above:\n815 = (39 * 100) / R + ((39 * 100) / R * R * 3) / 100\n\nNow, let's solve for R:\nR = 13\n\nNow, we can find the value of P:\nP = (39 * 100) / 13\nP = 3000\n\nSo, the sum is Rs. 3000.\n\nThe answer is {3000}.",

So there are 30 multiples of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 150.\n\nHowever, some of these multiples of 5 have more than one factor of 5. For example, 25 has two factors of 5 (since 25 = 5 * 5), and 125 has three factors of 5 (since 125 = 5 * 5 * 5). We need to count these extra factors of 5.\n\nThere are 6 multiples of 25 in the numbers from 1 to 150 (since 150 / 25 = 6). Each of these contributes an extra factor of 5, so we have 6 extra factors of 5.\n\nThere is 1 multiple of 125 in the numbers from 1 to 150 (since 150 / 125 = 1.2, but we only count whole numbers). This contributes two extra factors of 5 (since we already counted one of the factors when we counted multiples of 25).\n\nSo, the total number of factors of 5 in the product of the integers from 1 to 150 is 30 (from the multiples of 5) + 6 (from the multiples of 25) + 2 (from the multiple of 125) = 38.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of y is 38, and the answer is $\\boxed{38}$.",

So, for every 1 unit of A, there are 3 units of B. Since the ratio of chemical X and chemical Y in product M is 5:4, let's assume there are 5 units of chemical X and 4 units of chemical Y in product M.\n\nNow, let's find the amount of raw material B in 5 units of chemical X. Since the ratio of A and B is 1:3, in 5 units of chemical X, there will be (3/4) * 5 = 15/4 units of raw material B.\n\nIn chemical Y, the ratio of B and C is 2:1.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the total number of ways to select 3 books from the 8 available books. This can be done using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (total books) and k = 3 (books to be selected). So, the total number of ways to select 3 books is:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 books without any paperbacks. Since there are 6 hardbacks, this is the same as finding the number of ways to select 3 hardbacks from the 6 available hardbacks:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6*5*4) / (3*2*1) = 20\n\nNow, to find the number of ways to select 3 books with at least one paperback, we subtract the number of ways to select 3 books without any paperbacks from the total number of ways to select 3 books:\n\n56 (total ways) - 20 (ways without paperbacks) = 36\n\nSo, there are 36 possible selections of 3 books that include at least one paperback.\n\nThe final answer is {c) 36}.",

The average height would then be 1050 / 6 = 175 cm, which is the same as the initial average height.\n\nC) 173 cm and 178 cm\nThe total height of the group with these two people added would be 700 + 173 + 178 = 1051 cm. The average height would then be 1051 / 6 = 175.1667 cm, which is an increase from the initial average height.\n\nD) 176 cm and 176 cm\nThe total height of the group with these two people added would be 700 + 176 + 176 = 1052 cm. The average height would then be 1052 / 6 = 175.3333 cm, which is an increase from the initial average height.\n\nE) 174 cm and 177 cm\nThe total height of the group with these two people added would be 700 + 174 + 177 = 1051 cm. The average height would then be 1051 / 6 = 175.1667 cm, which is an increase from the initial average height.\n\nFrom the options above, only option B does not result in an increase in the average height when the two new people are added to the group. Therefore, the answer is {B}.",

This time is 40 minutes less than the original time, so we can write the equation:\n\n(d/x) - (d/(x+3)) = 40/60 (since we need to convert minutes to hours)\n\nSimilarly, if the man moved 2 kmph slower, his speed would be (x-2) kmph and the time taken would be (d/(x-2)) hours. This time is 40 minutes more than the original time, so we can write the equation:\n\n(d/(x-2)) - (d/x) = 40/60\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) (d/x) - (d/(x+3)) = 2/3\n2) (d/(x-2)) - (d/x) = 2/3\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of d and x.\n\nFirst, let's eliminate d from both equations by multiplying equation 1 by (x(x+3)) and equation 2 by (x(x-2)):\n\n1) d(x+3) - dx = 2x(x+3)/3\n2) dx - d(x-2) = 2x(x-2)/3\n\nNow, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\nd(x+3) - dx - (dx - d(x-2)) = 2x(x+3)/3 - 2x(x-2)/3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5d = 10x\n\nSo, d = 2x.\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of d back into either equation 1 or 2. Let's use equation 1:\n\n(2x/x) - (2x/(x+3)) = 2/3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2 - (2x/(x+3)) = 2/3\n\nMultiplying both sides by (x+3), we get:\n\n2(x+3) - 2x = 2(x+3)/3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6 = x+3\n\nSo, x = 3.\n\nNow, we can find the value of d using d = 2x:\n\nd = 2(3) = 6 km.\n\nHowever, this value of d is not in the given options.

Let's try solving them again using a different method.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equations as follows:\n\n1) d/x - d/(x+3) = 2/3\n2) d/(x-2) - d/x = 2/3\n\nNow, let's add both equations:\n\nd/(x-2) - d/(x+3) = 0\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by (x-2)(x+3):\n\nd(x+3) - d(x-2) = 0\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\ndx + 3d - dx + 2d = 0\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5d = 6x\n\nSo, d = 6x/5.\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of d back into either equation 1 or 2. Let's use equation 1:\n\n(6x/5x) - (6x/5(x+3)) = 2/3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6/5 - (6x/5(x+3)) = 2/3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5(x+3), we get:\n\n6(x+3) - 6x = 10(x+3)/3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n18 = 10x/3\n\nSo, x = 18*3/10 = 5.4 kmph.\n\nNow, we can find the value of d using d = 6x/5:\n\nd = 6(5.4)/5 = 6.48 km.\n\nAgain, this value of d is not in the given options. This means that either our calculations are still incorrect or the problem statement is incorrect.

After an increase of p% during the year, the number of livestock at the end of year 2000 can be represented as:\n\n130,000 * (1 + p/100)\n\nDuring the year 2001, there was a decrease of q%, so the number of livestock at the end of year 2001 can be represented as:\n\n130,000 * (1 + p/100) * (1 - q/100)\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of livestock at the end of year 2001 was 130,000. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n130,000 * (1 + p/100) * (1 - q/100) = 130,000\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 130,000:\n\n(1 + p/100) * (1 - q/100) = 1\n\nNow, let's expand the equation:\n\n1 + p/100 - q/100 - pq/10000 = 1\n\nWe can cancel out the 1 on both sides:\n\np/100 - q/100 - pq/10000 = 0\n\nNow, let's multiply both sides by 10000 to get rid of the fractions:\n\n100p - 100q - pq = 0\n\nNow, let's factor out 100:\n\n100(p - q) - pq = 0\n\nNow, let's analyze the equation.

What is the greatest possible number of pets that could have been adopted from the animal shelter between Monday and Friday?\nOptions:  A)10 B)11 C)12 D)13 E)14 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, let's find the maximum number of cats that could have been adopted. To do this, we want to maximize the number of cats in the shelter on Monday. Since there were 45 cats and dogs, let's assume there were 44 cats and 1 dog. Then, 1/5 of the cats would be 44/5 = 8.8, which we round down to 8 cats adopted.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum number of dogs that could have been adopted. Since we already assumed there was 1 dog in the shelter on Monday, 1/4 of the dogs would be 1/4 * 1 = 0.25, which we round down to 0 dogs adopted.\n\nSo, the greatest possible number of pets that could have been adopted from the animal shelter between Monday and Friday is 8 cats + 0 dogs = 8 pets. However, this is not one of the answer choices.\n\nLet's try another approach. Let's assume there were 40 cats and 5 dogs in the shelter on Monday. Then, 1/5 of the cats would be 40/5 = 8 cats adopted, and 1/4 of the dogs would be 5/4 = 1.25, which we round down to 1 dog adopted.\n\nSo, the greatest possible number of pets that could have been adopted from the animal shelter between Monday and Friday is 8 cats + 1 dog = 9 pets. However, this is also not one of the answer choices.\n\nLet's try one more approach. Let's assume there were 35 cats and 10 dogs in the shelter on Monday. Then, 1/5 of the cats would be 35/5 = 7 cats adopted, and 1/4 of the dogs would be 10/4 = 2.5, which we round down to 2 dogs adopted.\n\nSo, the greatest possible number of pets that could have been adopted from the animal shelter between Monday and Friday is 7 cats + 2 dogs = 9 pets. This is still not one of the answer choices.\n\nFinally, let's assume there were 30 cats and 15 dogs in the shelter on Monday. Then, 1/5 of the cats would be 30/5 = 6 cats adopted, and 1/4 of the dogs would be 15/4 = 3.75, which we round down to 3 dogs adopted.\n\nSo, the greatest possible number of pets that could have been adopted from the animal shelter between Monday and Friday is 6 cats + 3 dogs = 9 pets. This is still not one of the answer choices.\n\nIt seems that we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back to the case where there were 40 cats and 5 dogs in the shelter on Monday. Then, 1/5 of the cats would be 40/5 = 8 cats adopted, and 1/4 of the dogs would be 5/4 = 1.25, which we round up to 2 dogs adopted (since we want to maximize the number of pets adopted).\n\nSo, the greatest possible number of pets that could have been adopted from the animal shelter between Monday and Friday is 8 cats + 2 dogs = 10 pets.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A) }10}$.",

We can write the equation:\n\n5 * W + 4 * M = Total work done in a day\n\nSubstituting the values of W and M, we get:\n\n5 * (1/825) + 4 * (1/550) = Total work done in a day\n\nMultiplying the fractions, we get:\n\n5/825 + 4/550 = Total work done in a day\n\nTo add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 825 and 550 is 3300. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:\n\n(5 * 4) / (825 * 4) + (4 * 6) / (550 * 6) = Total work done in a day\n\n20/3300 + 24/3300 = Total work done in a day\n\nAdding the fractions, we get:\n\n44/3300 = Total work done in a day\n\nNow, let's find out how many days it will take for 5 women and 4 men to complete the project. We can write the equation:\n\n(44/3300) * D = 1 (project)\n\nWhere D is the number of days. Solving for D, we get:\n\nD = 3300 / 44\n\nD = 75\n\nSo, 5 women and 4 men working together can complete the project in 75 days.\n\nThe final answer is {75}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the prime factorization of 450. We can do this by dividing 450 by its smallest prime factor repeatedly:\n\n450 \u00f7 2 = 225\n225 \u00f7 3 = 75\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25\n25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 450 is 2 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5^2.\n\nNow, we know that n^2 is divisible by 450, which means that n^2 must have all the prime factors of 450 in its prime factorization. In other words, n^2 must have at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5.\n\nTo find the largest positive integer that must divide n, we need to find the smallest integer that has at least one factor of 2, one factor of 3, and one factor of 5.

            "Response": "First, let's find the rate at which pipes A and B fill the cistern. \n\nPipe A can fill the cistern in 10 minutes, so its rate is 1/10 of the cistern per minute.\nPipe B can fill the cistern in 15 minutes, so its rate is 1/15 of the cistern per minute.\n\nWhen both pipes are open, they fill the cistern at a combined rate of (1/10 + 1/15) per minute. To find this, we need to find a common denominator for 10 and 15, which is 30. So, the combined rate is (3/30 + 2/30) = 5/30 = 1/6 of the cistern per minute.\n\nNow, let's call the time it took for the cistern to be full with the waste pipe open as t minutes. During this time, pipes A and B filled (1/6)t of the cistern. \n\nWhen the waste pipe was closed, it took another 4 minutes for the cistern to be full. During these 4 minutes, pipes A and B filled (1/6)*4 = 2/3 of the cistern.\n\nSince the cistern was full after these two steps, we can write an equation:\n\n(1/6)t + 2/3 = 1\n\nNow, let's solve for t:\n\nt = 6 - 4 = 2 minutes\n\nSo, it took 2 minutes for the cistern to be full with the waste pipe open. During these 2 minutes, pipes A and B filled (1/6)*2 = 1/3 of the cistern.\n\nNow, let's call the rate at which the waste pipe empties the cistern as W. Since the cistern was full after 2 minutes with the waste pipe open, we can write another equation:\n\n(1/3) - 2W = 0\n\nNow, let's solve for W:\n\n2W = 1/3\n\nW = 1/6\n\nSo, the waste pipe empties the cistern at a rate of 1/6 per minute. To find the time it takes for the waste pipe to empty the cistern, we can write:\n\n1/6 * time = 1\n\ntime = 6 minutes\n\nSo, the waste pipe can empty the cistern in 6 minutes.

The hour hand is 112.5 degrees from the 12 (3 * 30 degrees per number + 3/4 * 30 degrees = 90 degrees + 22.5 degrees = 112.5 degrees).\n\nFinally, let's find the angle between the two hands. The angle between the two hands is the absolute difference between their angles from the 12: |270 degrees - 112.5 degrees| = 157.5 degrees.\n\nSo, the angle between the two hands at 3:45 is {157 1/2 degree}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the angle between the hour and minute hands at 8 o'clock. At 8 o'clock, the hour hand is at 240 degrees (8 * 30 degrees) and the minute hand is at 0 degrees. So, the angle between them is 240 degrees.\n\nNow, we need to find the time when the angle between the hour and minute hands is 180 degrees (i.e., they are in the same straight line but not together). Let's assume that the time is 8 hours and x minutes.\n\nIn x minutes, the minute hand will cover an angle of 6x degrees (since it covers 6 degrees per minute). Similarly, in x minutes, the hour hand will cover an angle of (x/60) * 30 degrees (since it covers 30 degrees per hour).\n\nSo, the angle between the hour and minute hands at 8 hours and x minutes will be:\n\n240 + (x/60) * 30 - 6x = 180\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n240 - 180 + (x/2) - 6x = 0\n60 = (x/2) - 6x\n60 = x - 12x\n60 = -11x\n\nx = -60/11\n\nSince the time cannot be negative, we need to find the time when the angle between the hour and minute hands is 180 degrees in the opposite direction. So, we need to find the time when the angle between the hour and minute hands is 360 - 180 = 180 degrees.\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n240 + (x/60) * 30 - 6x = 360 - 180\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n240 - 180 + (x/2) - 6x = 180\n60 = (x/2) - 6x\n60 = x - 12x\n60 = -11x\n\nx = 60/11\n\nSo, the time between 8 and 9 o'clock when the hands of a clock will be in the same straight line but not together is 8 hours and 60/11 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is {60/11}.",

So, C(6, 2) = 6! / (2!(6-2)!) = 6! / (2!4!) = (6*5) / (2*1) = 15 ways to choose 2 photos.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways the photographer can choose 3 photos out of 6.

In this case, 3x + 2 = 4k, so 3x = 4k - 2. Since the left side of the equation is divisible by 3, the right side must also be divisible by 3. However, 4k - 2 is not divisible by 3 for any integer k, so 4 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nB) 5: If y is divisible by 5, then y = 5k for some integer k. In this case, 3x + 2 = 5k, so 3x = 5k - 2.

Since the ratio of their investments is 1:2, they should share their profits in the same ratio.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {E)1:2}.",

If the side length of a square is 'a', then the diagonal 'd' can be found using the formula:\n\nd = \u221a(a\u00b2 + a\u00b2) = \u221a(2a\u00b2) = a\u221a2\n\nNow, let's say the diagonal of the first square is d1 and the diagonal of the second square is d2. Given that d1 is 3 times d2, we can write:\n\nd1 = 3d2\n\nNow, let's find the side lengths of the squares using the diagonal formula. Let the side length of the first square be a1 and the side length of the second square be a2. We can write:\n\na1 = d1/\u221a2\na2 = d2/\u221a2\n\nNow, let's find the perimeters of the squares.

The sequence of water filling in tank B is a geometric sequence with the first term a = 10 and the common ratio r = 2.\n\nThe formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:\n\nan = a * r^(n-1)\n\nSo, after 21 hours, the amount of water in tank B is:\n\na21 = 10 * 2^(21-1) = 10 * 2^20 = 10,485,760 liters\n\nSince tank B is 1/32 filled after 21 hours, we can find the total capacity of tank B:\n\nTotal capacity = 10,485,760 * 32 = 335,544,320 liters\n\nNow, we need to find out how many hours it takes to fill the remaining 31/32 of the tank. Let's denote the number of hours needed as x.\n\nIn the next hour, tank B will have 10 * 2^(21) liters of water. In the following hour, it will have 10 * 2^(22) liters, and so on.

The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^x) / (1 - r)\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n10 * 2^21 * (1 - 2^x) / (1 - 2) = 335,544,320 * 31/32\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n10 * 2^21 * (1 - 2^x) = 335,544,320 * 31\n\nNow, we need to solve for x.

So the distance between Town X and Town Z is:\n\nDistance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 9 hours = 540 miles\n\nSince Town Y is midway between Town X and Town Z, the distance between Town Y and Town Z is half of the distance between Town X and Town Z:\n\nDistance between Town Y and Town Z = 540 miles / 2 = 270 miles\n\nNow we need to find the time it takes John to drive from Town Z to Town Y at a rate of 85 miles per hour.

            "Response": "First, we need to find out how many part-time employees the company currently has. We know that 40% of the 100 employees are part-time, so we can calculate this as follows:\n\n100 employees * 0.40 = 40 part-time employees\n\nNow, let's find out how many part-time employees will be among the 25 new hires. We know that 40% of the 25 new employees will be part-time, so we can calculate this as follows:\n\n25 employees * 0.40 = 10 part-time employees\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of part-time employees after the new hires:\n\n40 part-time employees (current) + 10 part-time employees (new hires) = 50 part-time employees\n\nNow, we need to find the percent increase in part-time employees. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercent Increase = (New Number - Old Number) / Old Number * 100\n\nPercent Increase = (50 part-time employees - 40 part-time employees) / 40 part-time employees * 100\n\nPercent Increase = (10 part-time employees) / 40 part-time employees * 100\n\nPercent Increase = 0.25 * 100\n\nPercent Increase = 25%\n\nSo, the percent increase in part-time employees is 25%.

            "Response": "First, we know that the number of boys participating in the sports is 15. Since the ratio of boys to girls participating in the sports is 3:2, we can find the number of girls participating in the sports.\n\n15 boys = 3 parts\n1 part = 15/3 = 5\n2 parts (girls) = 5 * 2 = 10\n\nSo, there are 10 girls participating in the sports.\n\nNow, we know that the number of girls not participating in the sports is 5 more than the number of boys not participating in the sports. Let's use the information that there are 60 students in the class.\n\nTotal students = 60\nTotal participating in sports = 15 boys + 10 girls = 25\n\nSo, there are 60 - 25 = 35 students not participating in the sports.\n\nLet G be the number of girls not participating in the sports and B be the number of boys not participating in the sports.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the number of ways to select 4 chairs from 5 chairs. This can be done using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (total chairs) and k = 4 (chairs to be selected). So, the number of ways to select 4 chairs from 5 chairs is:\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5! / (4!1!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (4*3*2*1) = 5.\n\nNow, we know that there are 75 different combinations possible for selecting 4 chairs and 4 tables. Since we already know the number of ways to select 4 chairs (which is 5), we can find the number of ways to select 4 tables by dividing the total combinations by the number of ways to select chairs:\n\nNumber of ways to select 4 tables = Total combinations / Number of ways to select 4 chairs = 75 / 5 = 15.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of tables in the warehouse. Let's denote the number of tables as x. We know that the number of ways to select 4 tables from x tables is 15. So, we can write the equation:\n\nC(x, 4) = 15.\n\nWe need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.

            "Response": "First, let's find the distance the train travels to overtake each person. We can use the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time.\n\nFor the first person:\nDistance1 = 4.5 km/hr \u00d7 8.4 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds) = 0.0105 km\n\nFor the second person:\nDistance2 = 5.4 km/hr \u00d7 8.5 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds) = 0.01275 km\n\nNow, let's denote the speed of the train as V km/hr. Since the train and the persons are moving in the same direction, we can find the relative speed of the train with respect to each person.\n\nRelative speed1 = V - 4.5 km/hr\nRelative speed2 = V - 5.4 km/hr\n\nNow, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it takes for the train to travel the distances we found earlier.\n\nTime1 = Distance1 / Relative speed1 = 0.0105 km / (V - 4.5 km/hr)\nTime2 = Distance2 / Relative speed2 = 0.01275 km / (V - 5.4 km/hr)\n\nWe know that Time1 = 8.4 seconds and Time2 = 8.5 seconds. So, we can set up two equations:\n\n8.4 seconds = 0.0105 km / (V - 4.5 km/hr) \u00d7 (3600 seconds / 1 hr)\n8.5 seconds = 0.01275 km / (V - 5.4 km/hr) \u00d7 (3600 seconds / 1 hr)\n\nNow, we can solve these equations for V:\n\n8.4 = 0.0105 \u00d7 3600 / (V - 4.5)\n8.5 = 0.01275 \u00d7 3600 / (V - 5.4)\n\nSolving the first equation for V:\n\nV - 4.5 = 0.0105 \u00d7 3600 / 8.4\nV - 4.5 = 4.5\nV = 9 km/hr\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of V into the second equation:\n\n8.5 = 0.01275 \u00d7 3600 / (9 - 5.4)\n8.5 = 0.01275 \u00d7 3600 / 3.6\n\nSolving for V:\n\nV - 5.4 = 0.01275 \u00d7 3600 / 8.5\nV - 5.4 = 5.4\nV = 10.8 km/hr\n\nSince both equations give different values for V, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given options.

To do this, we multiply by 1000 (to convert km to meters) and divide by 3600 (to convert hours to seconds):\n\n150 kmph * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 150 * 1000 / 3600 = 150 / 3.6 = 41.67 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the total distance the trains need to cover to be completely clear of each other.

            "Response": "First, let's find the distance the train travels to overtake each person. We know that distance = speed \u00d7 time, so:\n\nDistance to overtake the first person = 4.5 km/hr \u00d7 8.4 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds) = 0.0105 km\nDistance to overtake the second person = 5.4 km/hr \u00d7 8.5 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds) = 0.01275 km\n\nNow, let's denote the speed of the train as V km/hr. Since the train and the persons are moving in the same direction, we can find the relative speed between them:\n\nRelative speed with the first person = V - 4.5 km/hr\nRelative speed with the second person = V - 5.4 km/hr\n\nWe can now use the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time to find the relative speed of the train with each person:\n\n0.0105 km = (V - 4.5 km/hr) \u00d7 8.4 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds)\n0.01275 km = (V - 5.4 km/hr) \u00d7 8.5 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds)\n\nNow, we can simplify these equations:\n\n0.0105 km = (V - 4.5 km/hr) \u00d7 0.002333 hr\n0.01275 km = (V - 5.4 km/hr) \u00d7 0.002361 hr\n\nDivide both sides of each equation by the time:\n\nV - 4.5 km/hr = 0.0105 km / 0.002333 hr = 4.5 km/hr\nV - 5.4 km/hr = 0.01275 km / 0.002361 hr = 5.4 km/hr\n\nNow, we can solve for V:\n\nV = 4.5 km/hr + 4.5 km/hr = 9 km/hr\nV = 5.4 km/hr + 5.4 km/hr = 10.8 km/hr\n\nSince the train has the same speed in both cases, we can average the two values:\n\nV = (9 km/hr + 10.8 km/hr) / 2 = 9.9 km/hr\n\nHowever, this is the relative speed of the train with respect to the persons. To find the actual speed of the train, we need to add the speed of the slower person:\n\nActual speed of the train = 9.9 km/hr + 4.5 km/hr = 14.4 km/hr\n\nSince this is not one of the options, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe made a mistake in calculating the distance the train travels to overtake each person. We should have used the relative speed of the train, not the speed of the persons. Let's correct this:\n\nDistance to overtake the first person = (V - 4.5 km/hr) \u00d7 8.4 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds)\nDistance to overtake the second person = (V - 5.4 km/hr) \u00d7 8.5 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds)\n\nNow, we can set these two distances equal to each other, since the train travels the same distance to overtake both persons:\n\n(V - 4.5 km/hr) \u00d7 8.4 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds) = (V - 5.4 km/hr) \u00d7 8.5 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factors:\n\n(V - 4.5 km/hr) \u00d7 8.4 = (V - 5.4 km/hr) \u00d7 8.5\n\nNow, we can solve for V:\n\n8.4V - 37.8 = 8.5V - 45.9\n\n1.1V = 8.1\n\nV = 8.1 / 1.1 = 7.36 km/hr\n\nNow, we need to add the speed of the slower person to find the actual speed of the train:\n\nActual speed of the train = 7.36 km/hr + 4.5 km/hr = 11.86 km/hr\n\nThis is still not one of the options, so we must have made another mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.\n\nWe made a mistake in converting the time from seconds to hours. We should have used the conversion factor (1 hr / 3600 seconds) in both equations. Let's correct this:\n\n(V - 4.5 km/hr) \u00d7 8.4 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds) = (V - 5.4 km/hr) \u00d7 8.5 seconds \u00d7 (1 hr / 3600 seconds)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factors:\n\n(V - 4.5 km/hr) \u00d7 8.4 = (V - 5.4 km/hr) \u00d7 8.5\n\nNow, we can solve for V:\n\n8.4V - 37.8 = 8.5V - 45.9\n\n0.1V = 8.1\n\nV = 8.1 / 0.1 = 81 km/hr\n\nNow, we have found the correct speed of the train: 81 km/hr. So, the final answer is:\n\n{81 km/hr}",

            "Response": "First, let's call the speed of Jones on his first trip S and the time it took him T. We know that distance = speed \u00d7 time, so for the first trip, we have:\n\n50 miles = S \u00d7 T\n\nNow, on his second trip, he traveled 300 miles and went three times as fast. So his speed was 3S and his time was T2. We can write the equation for the second trip as:\n\n300 miles = (3S) \u00d7 T2\n\nWe want to find the relationship between T2 and T. To do this, we can first solve the first equation for S:\n\nS = 50 miles / T\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for S into the second equation:\n\n300 miles = (3 \u00d7 (50 miles / T)) \u00d7 T2\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n300 miles = 150 miles \u00d7 T2 / T\n\nNow, we can solve for T2:\n\nT2 = (300 miles / 150 miles) \u00d7 T\n\nT2 = 2 \u00d7 T\n\nSo, Jones' new time compared with the old time was twice as much.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the sum of 1/3 and 22/99. To do this, we need a common denominator, which in this case is 99. So we have:\n\n(1/3) + (22/99) = (33/99) + (22/99) = (33+22)/99 = 55/99\n\nNow we need to convert this fraction to a decimal. To do this, we can divide 55 by 99:\n\n55 \u00f7 99 \u2248 0.555555...\n\nWe can see that the decimal is repeating, with a repeating block of \"55\". \n\nNow we need to find the 3000th digit to the right of the decimal place. Since the repeating block has a length of 2, we can divide 3000 by 2 to find out how many full repeating blocks there are before the 3000th digit:\n\n3000 \u00f7 2 = 1500\n\nThis means that there are 1500 full repeating blocks of \"55\" before the 3000th digit. Since each block has a length of 2, the 3000th digit will be the second digit in the 1500th block. In other words, the 3000th digit is the same as the second digit in the repeating block \"55\", which is 5.\n\nSo the 3000th digit to the right of the decimal place is 5.\n\nThe final answer is {C}.",

            "Response": "First, let's find the possible values of x and y based on the given conditions.\n\nFor (x+1)^2 to be less than or equal to 16, we have:\n(x+1)^2 <= 16\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n-4 <= x+1 <= 4\nSubtracting 1 from all sides, we have:\n-5 <= x <= 3\n\nSo the possible integer values of x are: -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nNow for (y-1)^2 to be less than 64, we have:\n(y-1)^2 < 64\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n-8 < y-1 < 8\nAdding 1 to all sides, we have:\n-7 < y < 9\n\nSo the possible integer values of y are: -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\nNow we need to find the maximum and minimum possible values of xy.\n\nFor the maximum value of xy, we can either have a large positive x and a large positive y, or a large negative x and a large negative y. Since the largest positive value of x is 3 and the largest positive value of y is 8, the maximum positive value of xy is 3*8 = 24. The largest negative value of x is -5 and the largest negative value of y is -6, so the maximum negative value of xy is -5*(-6) = 30. Since 30 is greater than 24, the maximum possible value of xy is 30.\n\nFor the minimum value of xy, we can either have a large positive x and a large negative y, or a large negative x and a large positive y. The largest positive value of x is 3 and the largest negative value of y is -6, so the minimum positive value of xy is 3*(-6) = -18. The largest negative value of x is -5 and the largest positive value of y is 8, so the minimum negative value of xy is -5*8 = -40. Since -40 is less than -18, the minimum possible value of xy is -40.\n\nFinally, we need to find the sum of the maximum and minimum possible values of xy, which is 30 + (-40) = -10.\n\nSo the answer is B) -10.",

Since the inscribed circle touches the quarter circle at point C, OC is perpendicular to the tangent at point C. Let's call the point where OC intersects AB as D.\n\nNow, we have a right-angled triangle ODC, where OD = r (radius of the inscribed circle), DC = r, and OC = 20 - r (since OC is the difference between the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the inscribed circle).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ODC, we have:\n\nOD^2 + DC^2 = OC^2\nr^2 + r^2 = (20 - r)^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2r^2 = 400 - 40r + r^2\nr^2 = 400 - 40r\nr^2 + 40r - 400 = 0\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for r using the quadratic formula:\n\nr = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 40, and c = -400. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nr = (-40 \u00b1 sqrt(40^2 - 4(1)(-400))) / 2(1)\nr = (-40 \u00b1 sqrt(1600 + 1600)) / 2\nr = (-40 \u00b1 sqrt(3200)) / 2\nr = (-40 \u00b1 40\u221a2) / 2\n\nSince r cannot be negative, we take the positive value:\n\nr = (40\u221a2 - 40) / 2\nr = 20(\u221a2 - 1)\n\nSo, the radius of the inscribed circle is 20(\u221a2 - 1), which corresponds to option A.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is {A}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the prime factorization of x. Since x is the product of each integer from 1 to 25, we can find the prime factors of each of these integers and then combine them to find the prime factorization of x.\n\nThe prime numbers between 1 and 25 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. We can find the number of times each of these primes appears in the factorization of x by dividing 25 by the prime, then dividing the result by the prime again, and so on, until the result is less than the prime. This is because each time we divide, we are counting the number of multiples of the prime in the range 1 to 25.\n\nFor example, for the prime 2, we have:\n\n25 / 2 = 12 (there are 12 multiples of 2 in the range 1 to 25)\n12 / 2 = 6 (there are 6 multiples of 4 in the range 1 to 25)\n6 / 2 = 3 (there are 3 multiples of 8 in the range 1 to 25)\n3 / 2 = 1 (there is 1 multiple of 16 in the range 1 to 25)\n\nSo the prime factorization of x includes 2^22.\n\nWe can do the same for the other primes:\n\n3: 25 / 3 = 8, 8 / 3 = 2 (2^10)\n5: 25 / 5 = 5, 5 / 5 = 1 (5^6)\n7: 25 / 7 = 3 (7^3)\n11: 25 / 11 = 2 (11^2)\n13: 25 / 13 = 1 (13^1)\n17: 25 / 17 = 1 (17^1)\n19: 25 / 19 = 1 (19^1)\n23: 25 / 23 = 1 (23^1)\n\nNow we need to find the greatest value of k for which y = 100^k is a factor of x. Since 100 = 2^2 * 5^2, we need to find the greatest value of k such that 2^(2k) * 5^(2k) is a factor of x.\n\nFrom the prime factorization of x, we know that x has 2^22 * 5^6 as factors. So we need to find the greatest value of k such that 2^(2k) * 5^(2k) <= 2^22 * 5^6.\n\nWe can rewrite this inequality as:\n\n2^(2k) <= 2^22 and 5^(2k) <= 5^6\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides of each inequality, we get:\n\n2k <= 22 and 2k <= 6\n\nFrom these inequalities, we can see that the greatest value of k that satisfies both inequalities is k = 3.\n\nSo the greatest value of k for which y is a factor of x is 3.\n\nThe final answer is C) 3.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the day when the prices of both commodities will be equal. To do that, we need to solve the equation:\n\n100 + 0.1n = 89 + 0.15n\n\nNow, let's solve for n:\n\n0.05n = 11\nn = 11 / 0.05\nn = 220\n\nSo, the prices will be equal on the 220th day of 2007.\n\nNow, let's find the date corresponding to the 220th day of 2007. We know that:\n\n- January has 31 days\n- February has 28 days (since 2007 is not a leap year)\n- March has 31 days\n- April has 30 days\n- May has 31 days\n\nNow, let's add up the days:\n\n31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) = 120 days\n\nSo, by the end of April, 120 days have passed. We need to find the date in May when the 220th day occurs:\n\n220 - 120 = 100\n\nSo, the 220th day is the 100th day of May. Since May has 31 days, the 100th day of May is:\n\n100 - 31 = 69\n\nSo, the 220th day of 2007 is the 69th day of June. Since June has 30 days, the 69th day of June is:\n\n69 - 30 = 39\n\nSo, the 220th day of 2007 is the 39th day of July. Therefore, the prices of the two commodities will be equal on the 39th day of July, which is:\n\nJuly 39th\n\nSince there is no such date as July 39th, we need to find the equivalent date in August:\n\n39 - 31 = 8\n\nSo, the 220th day of 2007 is August 8th.\n\nThe correct answer is not in the given options.",

            "Response": "At 3:40, the minute hand is at the 8 on the clock, while the hour hand is 2/3 of the way between the 3 and the 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the angle of the minute hand from the 12. Since there are 12 hours on a clock, each hour mark is 360\u00b0/12 = 30\u00b0 apart. The minute hand is at the 8, which is 4 hours away from the 12, so the angle is 4 * 30\u00b0 = 120\u00b0.\n\nNow, let's find the angle of the hour hand from the 12. Since there are 12 hours on a clock, each hour mark is 360\u00b0/12 = 30\u00b0 apart. The hour hand is 2/3 of the way between the 3 and the 4, so it is 3.67 hours away from the 12. The angle is 3.67 * 30\u00b0 = 110\u00b0.\n\nFinally, let's find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand. Since the minute hand is at a larger angle, we can subtract the angle of the hour hand from the angle of the minute hand: 120\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 10\u00b0.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. We made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe made a mistake in calculating the angle of the hour hand. At 3:40, the hour hand is not 2/3 of the way between the 3 and the 4, but rather 2/3 of the way between the 3 and the 4 in terms of the angle. Since each hour mark is 30\u00b0 apart, the angle between the 3 and the 4 is 30\u00b0. So, the hour hand is 2/3 * 30\u00b0 = 20\u00b0 past the 3.\n\nNow, let's find the angle of the hour hand from the 12 again. The hour hand is at the 3, which is 3 hours away from the 12, so the angle is 3 * 30\u00b0 = 90\u00b0. Adding the extra 20\u00b0 we found earlier, the total angle of the hour hand from the 12 is 90\u00b0 + 20\u00b0 = 110\u00b0.\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand again. Since the minute hand is at a larger angle, we can subtract the angle of the hour hand from the angle of the minute hand: 120\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 10\u00b0.\n\nThis is still not one of the given options. We made another mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.\n\nWe made a mistake in calculating the angle of the minute hand. At 3:40, the minute hand is not at the 8, but rather 40 minutes past the 12. Since there are 60 minutes on a clock, each minute mark is 360\u00b0/60 = 6\u00b0 apart. The minute hand is 40 minutes away from the 12, so the angle is 40 * 6\u00b0 = 240\u00b0.\n\nNow, let's find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand again. Since the minute hand is at a larger angle, we can subtract the angle of the hour hand from the angle of the minute hand: 240\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 130\u00b0.\n\nSo, the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:40 is 130\u00b0.\n\nThe final answer is {130\u00b0}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the original price of the article before the sales tax was added. Since the rate of sales tax is 10%, we can represent the original price as x and the sales tax as 0.1x. So, the equation will be:\n\nx + 0.1x = 616\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n1.1x = 616\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 1.1:\n\nx = 616 / 1.1\n\nx = 560\n\nSo, the original price of the article before the sales tax was added is Rs. 560.\n\nNow, we know that the shopkeeper made a profit of 12%. Let's represent the cost price of the article as y. The equation will be:\n\ny + 0.12y = 560\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n1.12y = 560\n\nNow, we can solve for y by dividing both sides by 1.12:\n\ny = 560 / 1.12\n\ny = 500\n\nSo, the cost price of the article is Rs. 500.\n\nThe final answer is {500}.",

In this case, we have:\n\n140 = (20 * (a1 + a20)) / 2\n\nSince each term is obtained by adding 2 to the preceding one, we can write a20 as a1 + 19 * 2, or a1 + 38. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n140 = (20 * (a1 + a1 + 38)) / 2\n\nSimplifying and solving for a1, we find:\n\n140 = 10 * (2a1 + 38)\n14 = 2a1 + 38\n2a1 = -24\na1 = -12\n\nNow that we know the first term, we can find the 40th term, a40.

            "Response": "First, let's find out how much money George spent on the 15 mangoes. Since he can buy 40 mangoes with all his money, the cost of 1 mango is (total money)/40. So, the cost of 15 mangoes is 15*(total money)/40.\n\nNow, let's find out how much money George has left after retaining 15% for taxi fare. He has 85% of his total money left, which is 0.85*(total money).\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to find out how many oranges George can buy with the remaining money. Let x be the number of oranges he can buy. The cost of x oranges is x*(total money)/50.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\nx*(total money)/50 = 0.85*(total money) - 15*(total money)/40\n\nTo solve for x, we can first cancel out the (total money) term from both sides:\n\nx/50 = 0.85 - 15/40\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 50*(0.85 - 15/40)\n\nx = 50*(0.85 - 0.375)\n\nx = 50*0.475\n\nx = 23.75\n\nSince George can't buy a fraction of an orange, he can buy 23 oranges.

We know that the area of a square is side^2, and we are given that the area is 1/2 hectare. \n\n1 hectare = 10,000 square meters, so 1/2 hectare = 5,000 square meters.\n\nLet s be the side length of the square.

So the probability of drawing a red apple on the second draw is at most $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nFor the third draw, there are now 7 total apples, and at most 6 of them are red (if the first two apples eaten were both red). So the probability of drawing a red apple on the third draw is at most $\\frac{6}{7}$.\n\nWe can continue this process for each draw.

To do this, we multiply the speed in kmph by (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr).\n\nRelative speed = 36 kmph * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 10 m/s\n\nNext, we need to find the total length that the faster train needs to cover to completely cross the slower train.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the prime factorization of 435,961.

Now we need to check if 1,271 is prime or can be factored further. \n\n1,271 \u00f7 3 = 423 + 2 (remainder)\n1,271 \u00f7 5 = 254 + 1 (remainder)\n1,271 \u00f7 7 = 181 + 4 (remainder)\n\nSince 1,271 cannot be divided by 3, 5, or 7, we can assume it is prime. \n\nSo, the prime factorization of 435,961 is 7^3 \u00d7 1,271. \n\nNow we know that 21^k is a divisor of 435,961. Since 21 = 3 \u00d7 7, we can rewrite 21^k as (3 \u00d7 7)^k = 3^k \u00d7 7^k. \n\nSince 7^3 is the highest power of 7 that divides 435,961, we must have k = 3. \n\nNow we can find 7^k - k^7:\n\n7^3 - 3^7 = 343 - 2,187 = -1,844.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this result. This is because we made an error in our calculations. The correct expression for 21^k is (3 \u00d7 7)^k = 3^k \u00d7 7^k, not 3^k \u00d7 7^3. \n\nSo, we need to find the highest power of 3 that divides 435,961.

So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(1/6)x * 0.25 + (2/6)x * 0.10 + (3/6)x * 0.05 = 30\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n(1/6)x * 0.25 + (1/3)x * 0.10 + (1/2)x * 0.05 = 30\n\n0.0416667x + 0.0333333x + 0.025x = 30\n\n0.1x = 30\n\nx = 300\n\nSo, there are a total of 300 coins in the bag.\n\nNow, we can find the number of 25 paise coins using the given ratio:\n\n(1/6) * 300 = 50\n\nSo, there are 50 25 paise coins in the bag.\n\nThe final answer is {50}.",

The average price of the blankets is Rs.150, so the total cost of all the blankets is:\n\n10 blankets * Rs.150 = Rs.1500\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to find the unknown rate of the two blankets:\n\nTotal cost of all blankets = cost of 3 blankets at Rs.100 each + cost of 5 blankets at Rs.150 each + cost of 2 blankets at unknown rate\n\nRs.1500 = Rs.300 + Rs.750 + 2x\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nRs.1500 - Rs.300 - Rs.750 = 2x\nRs.450 = 2x\nx = Rs.225\n\nSo, the unknown rate of the two blankets is Rs.225 each.

            "Response": "First, let's find the weight loss per kg for both tin and silver.\n\nFor tin:\nWeight loss = 1.375 kg (for 10 kg of tin)\nSo, weight loss per kg of tin = 1.375 / 10 = 0.1375 kg\n\nFor silver:\nWeight loss = 0.375 kg (for 5 kg of silver)\nSo, weight loss per kg of silver = 0.375 / 5 = 0.075 kg\n\nNow, let's assume there are x kg of tin and y kg of silver in the 30 kg metal bar. We know that the total weight of the bar is 30 kg, so we can write the equation:\n\nx + y = 30\n\nWe also know that the bar lost 3 kg of its weight in the water. So, the total weight loss for the tin and silver in the bar can be written as:\n\n0.1375x + 0.075y = 3\n\nNow, we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n\n1) x + y = 30\n2) 0.1375x + 0.075y = 3\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method. From equation 1, we can write:\n\ny = 30 - x\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y in equation 2:\n\n0.1375x + 0.075(30 - x) = 3\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n0.1375x + 2.25 - 0.075x = 3\n0.0625x = 0.75\nx = 12\n\nNow, substitute the value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = 30 - 12\ny = 18\n\nSo, there are 12 kg of tin and 18 kg of silver in the 30 kg metal bar. The ratio of tin to silver is:\n\n12 : 18\n\nWe can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (6):\n\n(12/6) : (18/6)\n2 : 3\n\nSo, the ratio of tin to silver in the bar is 2:3.\n\nThe final answer is {2/3}.",

So, the total surface area of the cube is 6 * 100 = 600 square feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many quarts of paint are needed to cover the 600 square feet. Since 1 quart covers 1200 square feet, we can set up a proportion: (1 quart) / (1200 square feet) = (x quarts) / (600 square feet).

Since the policeman is running faster, we can subtract the speed of the thief from the speed of the policeman.\n\nRelative speed = Speed of policeman - Speed of thief\nRelative speed = 10 km/hr - 8 km/hr\nRelative speed = 2 km/hr\n\nNow, we need to convert the relative speed to meters per second, as the distance is given in meters. We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.\n\nRelative speed = 2 km/hr * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s)\nRelative speed = 2000 m/3600 s\nRelative speed = 5/9 m/s\n\nNow, we can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\n\nWe know the distance between the policeman and the thief initially is 100 meters. We need to find the time it takes for the policeman to cover this distance at the relative speed.\n\n100 m = (5/9 m/s) * Time\nTime = 100 m / (5/9 m/s)\nTime = 100 * (9/5) s\nTime = 180 s\n\nNow that we have the time, we can find the distance the thief has run before he is overtaken.

To do this, we simply add their individual rates:\n\nCombined rate = (1/18) + (1/40)\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 40. The LCM of 18 and 40 is 360.

If, on January 1, 2013,James has the same total amount of retirement savings as he did two years before, then x is between\nOptions:  A)10 and 20 B)20 and 30 C)30 and 40 D)40 and 50 E)50 and 60 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, let's find out how much James' retirement savings increased in 2011. Since 80% of his savings were in largecaps, which rose 10%, this portion of his savings increased by 0.8 * 10% = 8%. Similarly, 10% of his savings were in midcaps, which also rose 10%, so this portion increased by 0.1 * 10% = 1%. Finally, 10% of his savings were in smallcaps, which rose 20%, so this portion increased by 0.1 * 20% = 2%. In total, his retirement savings increased by 8% + 1% + 2% = 11% in 2011.\n\nNow let's consider 2012. Largecaps fell 5%, so the 80% of his savings in largecaps decreased by 0.8 * 5% = 4%. Midcaps fell 10%, so the 10% of his savings in midcaps decreased by 0.1 * 10% = 1%. We don't know the exact percentage increase for smallcaps, but we can represent it as x%. Therefore, the 10% of his savings in smallcaps increased by 0.1 * x%.\n\nSince James has the same total amount of retirement savings on January 1, 2013, as he did two years before, the total percentage change in his savings over the two years must be 0%. We can represent this with the following equation:\n\n11% - 4% - 1% + 0.1 * x% = 0%\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6% + 0.1 * x% = 0%\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n0.1 * x% = -6%\n\nx% = -6% / 0.1 = -60%\n\nSince x represents the percentage increase in smallcaps, it must be positive. Therefore, we made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nIn 2011, James' retirement savings increased by 11%. In 2012, the largecap and midcap portions of his savings decreased by a total of 4% + 1% = 5%. To have the same total amount of retirement savings at the end of 2012 as he did at the beginning of 2011, the smallcap portion of his savings must increase by enough to offset the 5% decrease from the largecap and midcap portions. Since the smallcap portion represents 10% of his savings, we can represent this with the following equation:\n\n0.1 * x% = 5%\n\nx% = 5% / 0.1 = 50%\n\nSo, the smallcap portion of James' retirement savings must increase by 50% in 2012 to have the same total amount of retirement savings at the end of the two-year period. Since the smallcaps rose between 10% and 20% in 2011, the total percentage increase for smallcaps over the two years must be between 60% and 70%. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nx is between 50 and 60, or {E}.",

The square root of 3.5 is approximately 1.87.\n\nNext, let's find the square root of 10^9.

            "Response": "First, let's recall the formula for the volume of a cone: V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nWe are given that the volumes of the two cones are in the ratio 1 : 10, so we can write:\n\nV1 / V2 = 1 / 10\n\nWe are also given that the radii of the cones are in the ratio 1 : 2, so we can write:\n\nr1 / r2 = 1 / 2\n\nNow, let's use the formula for the volume of a cone to write the volumes in terms of the radii and heights:\n\n(1/3)\u03c0(r1^2)(h1) / (1/3)\u03c0(r2^2)(h2) = 1 / 10\n\nNotice that the (1/3)\u03c0 terms cancel out:\n\n(r1^2)(h1) / (r2^2)(h2) = 1 / 10\n\nNow, let's substitute the ratio of the radii into the equation:\n\n((1/2)^2)(h1) / (1^2)(h2) = 1 / 10\n\n(1/4)(h1) / (h2) = 1 / 10\n\nNow, let's solve for the ratio of the heights:\n\nh1 / h2 = 4 / 10\n\nh1 / h2 = 2 / 5\n\nSo, the ratio of the heights of the cones is 2 : 5.\n\nNow, let's find the length of the wire. The wire goes along the slant height of each cone, so we need to find the ratio of the slant heights. Let's use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the radius, height, and slant height of a cone:\n\nslant height^2 = radius^2 + height^2\n\nLet's find the ratio of the slant heights of the two cones:\n\n(slant height1 / slant height2)^2 = (r1^2 + h1^2) / (r2^2 + h2^2)\n\nWe know the ratio of the radii (1 : 2) and the ratio of the heights (2 : 5), so we can substitute those values into the equation:\n\n(slant height1 / slant height2)^2 = ((1^2 + 2^2) / (2^2 + 5^2))\n\n(slant height1 / slant height2)^2 = (5 / 29)\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find the ratio of the slant heights:\n\nslant height1 / slant height2 = \u221a(5 / 29)\n\nSince the wire goes along the slant height of each cone, the length of the wire is in the same ratio as the slant heights:\n\nlength of wire = slant height1 / slant height2 = \u221a(5 / 29)\n\nSo, the length of the wire is in the ratio \u221a(5 / 29).

            "Response": "First, let's find out how much interest Manoj paid to Anwar for the borrowed amount of Rs.4200 at 6% p.a. simple interest for three years.\n\nSimple Interest = (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time) / 100\nInterest paid to Anwar = (4200 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3) / 100 = 756\n\nNow, let's assume Manoj added an amount 'x' to the borrowed sum and lent it to Ramu at 9% p.a. simple interest for the same time. So, the total amount lent to Ramu is (4200 + x).\n\nWe are given that Manoj gains Rs.824.85 by way of interest on the borrowed sum as well as his own amount from the whole transaction. So, the interest earned from Ramu should be the sum of the interest paid to Anwar and the gain of Manoj.\n\nInterest earned from Ramu = 756 + 824.85 = 1580.85\n\nNow, let's find out the interest earned by Manoj from Ramu at 9% p.a. simple interest for three years.\n\nSimple Interest = (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time) / 100\n1580.85 = ((4200 + x) \u00d7 9 \u00d7 3) / 100\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n1580.85 = (1260 + 27x) / 100\n158085 = 126000 + 2700x\n32085 = 2700x\nx = 32085 / 2700\nx = 11.88 (approximately)\n\nSo, Manoj added approximately Rs.11.88 to the borrowed sum and lent it to Ramu. Therefore, the sum lent by him to Ramu is:\n\n4200 + 11.88 = 4211.88\n\nSince the options given are all whole numbers, we can round this value to the nearest whole number, which is 4212.\n\nSo, the sum lent by Manoj to Ramu is approximately Rs.4212.\n\nThe final answer is {4212}.",

            "Response": "First, let's fix Mary's position with her back on the wall. Now, we have 2 females and 3 males left to arrange around the table.\n\nSince no male should sit next to a male and no female next to a female, we must alternate the remaining males and females around the table. We can think of the remaining females as \"spaces\" between the males, so we have 3 spaces for the 2 remaining females to sit.\n\nWe can arrange the 2 females in these 3 spaces in 3 ways (using the combination formula: C(3,2) = 3). For each of these arrangements, the 3 males can be arranged in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the 3 males and 3 females around the table is 3 (ways to arrange females) * 6 (ways to arrange males) = 18 ways.\n\nHowever, since the table is circular, we need to divide by the number of ways to rotate the table, which is 3 (one for each male-female pair).

            "Response": "First, let's consider the inequality |x+9|<x. \n\nIf x+9 is positive, then |x+9|=x+9, and the inequality becomes x+9<x, which simplifies to 9<0. This is not possible, so x+9 must be negative.\n\nIf x+9 is negative, then |x+9|=-(x+9), and the inequality becomes -(x+9)<x. This simplifies to -x-9<x, which further simplifies to -9<2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get -4.5<x.\n\nSince x is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for x is 1. We can see that 1 satisfies the inequality, as |1+9|=8<1. The next smallest possible value for x is 2, which also satisfies the inequality, as |2+9|=7<2. However, if we try x=3, we get |3+9|=6, which is not less than 3.

            "Response": "First, let's factor out the common factor of 6 from the expression:\n\n6n^2 + 6n = 6(n^2 + n)\n\nNow, we can see that the expression is always divisible by 6, since there is a factor of 6 in the expression. So, option A is correct.\n\nNow, let's check if the expression is also divisible by 12. To do this, we need to see if (n^2 + n) is always divisible by 2.\n\nIf n is even, then n^2 and n are both even, so their sum is also even. If n is odd, then n^2 is odd and n is odd, so their sum is even. Therefore, (n^2 + n) is always divisible by 2.\n\nSince the expression is divisible by both 6 and 2, it is also divisible by their least common multiple, which is 12. So, option B is correct.\n\nNow, let's check if the expression is divisible by 18. To do this, we need to see if (n^2 + n) is always divisible by 3.\n\nIf n is divisible by 3, then n^2 and n are both divisible by 3, so their sum is also divisible by 3. If n is not divisible by 3, then n^2 and n are not divisible by 3, so their sum may or may not be divisible by 3. Therefore, (n^2 + n) is not always divisible by 3.\n\nSince the expression is not always divisible by 18, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, the final answer is {B}.",

            "Response": "Let the speed of the stream be x km/hr.\n\nWhen the boat is going downstream, its effective speed is (20 + x) km/hr, since the stream helps the boat move faster.\nWhen the boat is going upstream, its effective speed is (20 - x) km/hr, since the stream opposes the boat's movement.\n\nNow, we are given that the time taken to travel 26 km downstream is the same as the time taken to travel 14 km upstream.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n(26) / (20 + x) = (14) / (20 - x)\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:\n\n26(20 - x) = 14(20 + x)\n\n520 - 26x = 280 + 14x\n\n40x = 240\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, the speed of the stream is 6 km/hr.\n\nThe final answer is {6}.",

Since the two middle barrels have a combined capacity of 20 gallons, this means that Q and R have a combined capacity of 32 - 20 = 12 gallons.\n\nTo maximize the capacity of the smallest barrel Q, we need to minimize the capacity of the largest barrel R. Since R must be at least as large as the median (10 gallons), the minimum capacity for R is 10 gallons.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible capacity for the smallest barrel Q is 12 - 10 = 2 gallons.\n\nSo, the final answer is {2}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the position of the hour and minute hands on the clock.\n\nFor the hour hand, it is at 4, but it has also moved a bit further because of the 18 minutes that have passed. The hour hand moves 360\u00b0 in 12 hours, so it moves 360\u00b0/12 = 30\u00b0 per hour. Since 18 minutes is 18/60 = 0.3 of an hour, the hour hand has moved an additional 0.3 * 30\u00b0 = 9\u00b0. So, the position of the hour hand is 4 * 30\u00b0 + 9\u00b0 = 120\u00b0 + 9\u00b0 = 129\u00b0.\n\nFor the minute hand, it is at 18 minutes. The minute hand moves 360\u00b0 in 60 minutes, so it moves 360\u00b0/60 = 6\u00b0 per minute. So, the position of the minute hand is 18 * 6\u00b0 = 108\u00b0.\n\nNow, we need to find the angle between the hour and minute hands. The difference in their positions is 129\u00b0 - 108\u00b0 = 21\u00b0. Since we are looking for the acute angle, our final answer is 21\u00b0.\n\nSo, the answer is {D)}.",

We know that 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. So, we can use the following conversion:\n\nSpeed in m/s = (Speed in km/hr) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s)\nSpeed in m/s = (99 km/hr) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the units and simplify:\n\nSpeed in m/s = (99 * 1000) / 3600\nSpeed in m/s = 99000 / 3600\nSpeed in m/s = 27.5 m/s\n\nNow, we can use the formula for time:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 495 m / 27.5 m/s\n\nNow, we can cancel out the units and simplify:\n\nTime = 495 / 27.5\nTime = 18 seconds\n\nSo, the train will pass the bridge in 18 seconds.

If the speed of the train is 54 km/hr, what is the length of the platform?\nOptions:  A)180 m B)160 m C)240 m D)207 m E)202 m Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. We know that 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. So, we have:\n\n54 km/hr * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) = 15 m/s\n\nNow, let's find the length of the train. Since the train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of train = Speed of train * Time taken to pass the man\nLength of train = 15 m/s * 20 s = 300 m\n\nNext, let's find the time taken by the train to pass the platform alone (without the man). Since the train takes 32 seconds to pass the platform and the man, and 20 seconds to pass the man alone, the time taken to pass the platform alone is:\n\nTime taken to pass platform alone = 32 s - 20 s = 12 s\n\nNow, we can find the length of the platform using the formula:\n\nLength of platform = (Speed of train * Time taken to pass platform alone) - Length of train\nLength of platform = (15 m/s * 12 s) - 300 m\nLength of platform = 180 m - 300 m = -120 m\n\nSince the length of the platform cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculation. The correct formula to find the length of the platform should be:\n\nLength of platform = (Speed of train * Time taken to pass platform alone) + Length of train\nLength of platform = (15 m/s * 12 s) + 300 m\nLength of platform = 180 m + 300 m = 480 m\n\nHowever, this answer is not in the given options. Let's recheck our calculations.\n\nWe made an error in interpreting the problem. The time taken to pass the platform includes the time taken to pass the man as well. So, we don't need to subtract the time taken to pass the man from the total time. We can directly use the formula:\n\nLength of platform = (Speed of train * Time taken to pass platform) - Length of train\nLength of platform = (15 m/s * 32 s) - 300 m\nLength of platform = 480 m - 300 m = 180 m\n\nSo, the correct answer is 180 m.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{180}.",

However, we can express the time taken by the leakage to empty the tank as a function of a:\n\nTime taken by leakage to empty the tank = b hours = a + 7a^2 hours.\n\nWithout knowing the value of a, we cannot determine the exact time taken by the leakage to empty the tank, so we cannot choose an option from A) to E).",

            "Response": "Since the average of the three integers is 24, we know that their sum is 72 (since $24 \\cdot 3 = 72$). We also know that the median is $(a + 11)$, which means that $b = a + 11$. \n\nNow we can write the sum of the three integers as $a + (a + 11) + c = 72$. Simplifying this equation gives us $2a + c = 61$. \n\nSince $a \\le b \\le c$, we know that $c \\ge b = a + 11$. So we want to find the smallest possible value of $c$ that satisfies this inequality and the equation $2a + c = 61$. \n\nIf we set $c = a + 11$, then the equation becomes $2a + (a + 11) = 61$, which simplifies to $3a = 50$. However, this does not give us an integer value for $a$, so we need to try a larger value for $c$. \n\nIf we set $c = a + 12$, then the equation becomes $2a + (a + 12) = 61$, which simplifies to $3a = 49$. This gives us $a = \\frac{49}{3}$, which is still not an integer. \n\nIf we set $c = a + 13$, then the equation becomes $2a + (a + 13) = 61$, which simplifies to $3a = 48$. This gives us $a = 16$, which is an integer. \n\nSo the least possible value of $c$ is $a + 13 = 16 + 13 = \\boxed{29}$. The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(D)}}$.",

            "Response": "In the first race, X beats Y by 20m in a 100m race. This means that when X finishes the race, Y has only covered 80m. \n\nNow, in the second race, X starts 10m behind the starting line, so X has to run a total of 110m. Since both run at the same previous speed, we can set up a proportion to determine how far Y will run when X finishes the second race.\n\nIn the first race, the proportion is X:Y = 100:80. In the second race, X runs 110m, so we can set up the proportion:\n\n100/80 = 110/Y\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n100Y = 80 * 110\n100Y = 8800\nY = 88\n\nSo when X finishes the second race, Y has run 88m.

This week, he earned more than twice as much as he did last week. If he sold x bicycles last week and y bicycles this week, which of the following statements must be true? I. y<2x II. y>x III. y>3\nOptions:  A)I,II only B)I only C)II only D)II,III only E)III only Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, let's find the expressions for David's earnings last week and this week.\n\nLast week, he sold x bicycles. His earnings would be:\n$40 + 6 * min(x, 6) + 12 * max(min(x - 6, 6), 0) + 18 * max(x - 12, 0)$\n\nThis week, he sold y bicycles. His earnings would be:\n$40 + 6 * min(y, 6) + 12 * max(min(y - 6, 6), 0) + 18 * max(y - 12, 0)$\n\nWe are given that his earnings this week are more than twice his earnings last week:\n$40 + 6 * min(y, 6) + 12 * max(min(y - 6, 6), 0) + 18 * max(y - 12, 0) > 2 * (40 + 6 * min(x, 6) + 12 * max(min(x - 6, 6), 0) + 18 * max(x - 12, 0))$\n\nNow let's analyze the statements:\n\nI. y < 2x\nThis statement is not necessarily true. For example, if David sold 5 bicycles last week and 11 bicycles this week, his earnings would be $70 and $172, respectively, which satisfies the given condition. However, in this case, y = 11 and 2x = 10, so y > 2x.\n\nII. y > x\nThis statement must be true. If David sold more bicycles this week than last week, his earnings would definitely be higher, since he earns more per bicycle as he sells more. If he sold fewer bicycles this week, his earnings would be lower, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, y must be greater than x.\n\nIII. y > 3\nThis statement must also be true. If David sold 3 or fewer bicycles this week, his maximum earnings would be $40 + 6 * 3 = $58. In order for his earnings to be more than twice his earnings last week, he would have had to earn $29 or less last week. However, his minimum earnings last week would be $40 (if he sold no bicycles), which is greater than $29. Therefore, y must be greater than 3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D) II, III only.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 candidates out of 7 for the mathematics department. This can be done using combinations, which is denoted as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\", where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be chosen. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSo for the mathematics department, we have:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1) = 35\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to select 5 candidates out of 8 for the computer science department. Using the same formula, we have:\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!(8-5)!) = 8! / (5!3!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of different sets of 3 candidates to fill the 3 positions. Since the positions in the computer science department are identical, we only need to consider the number of ways to select 1 candidate from the 5 chosen for the computer science department. This can be done in 5 ways.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to select candidates for each department and the number of ways to select 1 candidate from the computer science department:\n\nTotal sets = 35 (math) * 56 (computer science) * 5 (selecting 1 candidate from computer science)\nTotal sets = 35 * 56 * 5 = 9800\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the number of sets, since we have counted each set twice (once for each identical position in the computer science department). To correct for this, we need to divide the total number of sets by 2:\n\nTotal sets = 9800 / 2 = 4900\n\nSo there are 4900 different sets of 3 candidates to fill the 3 positions.

            "Response": "First, we find the midpoint of the chord PB. The midpoint M has coordinates ((-1+3)/2, (0+3)/2) = (1, 1.5).\n\nNext, we find the slope of the line PB. The slope is (3-0)/(3-(-1)) = 3/4.\n\nNow, we find the slope of the line perpendicular to PB and passing through M. The slope of this line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of PB, so it is -4/3.\n\nNow, we have the equation of the line passing through M and perpendicular to PB: y - 1.5 = -4/3(x - 1).\n\nNext, we find the radius of the circle. Since the area of the circle is (25/4)\u03c0, we have r^2 = 25/4, so r = 5/2.\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of the center of the circle. Let the center be C = (x, y). Since C is on the line passing through M and perpendicular to PB, we have y - 1.5 = -4/3(x - 1).\n\nAlso, since C is a distance of 5/2 from M, we have (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2 = (5/2)^2.\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations in two variables:\n\n1) y - 1.5 = -4/3(x - 1)\n2) (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2 = (5/2)^2\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution. From equation 1, we have y = -4/3(x - 1) + 1.5. Substituting this into equation 2, we get:\n\n(x - 1)^2 + (-4/3(x - 1) + 1.5 - 1.5)^2 = (5/2)^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(x - 1)^2 + (-4/3(x - 1))^2 = 25/4\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 1 + 16/9(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 25/4\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n(25/9)x^2 - (50/9)x + 25/9 = 25/4\n\nMultiplying both sides by 36, we get:\n\n100x^2 - 200x + 100 = 225\n\nDividing both sides by 25, we get:\n\n4x^2 - 8x + 4 = 9\n\nSubtracting 9 from both sides, we get:\n\n4x^2 - 8x - 5 = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(2x - 5)(2x + 1) = 0\n\nSo, x = 5/2 or x = -1/2. If x = 5/2, then y = -4/3(5/2 - 1) + 1.5 = 2. If x = -1/2, then y = -4/3(-1/2 - 1) + 1.5 = -5. Thus, the coordinates of the center of the circle are either (5/2, 2) or (-1/2, -5).\n\nSince the answer choices are given, we can see that the correct answer is (5/2, 2), which is answer choice E.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the center of the circle are (2, 2).\n\nThe final answer is {E}.",

            "Response": "First, let's find the dimensions of the figure created by the 128 cubes. Since the width is twice the length and twice the height, let the length be x, the height be y, and the width be 2x and 2y. Then, the volume of the figure is x * y * (2x) * (2y) = 128.\n\nNow, let's find the dimensions of the foil-covered prism. Since each side of the figure is covered in foil, we need to add 2 to each dimension (1 for each side). So, the dimensions of the foil-covered prism are (x+2), (y+2), (2x+2), and (2y+2).\n\nWe are asked to find the width of the foil-covered prism, which is 2x+2. To do this, we need to find the values of x and y.\n\nFrom the volume equation, we have x * y * (2x) * (2y) = 128. Simplifying, we get 4x^2 * y^2 = 128. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x^2 * y^2 = 32.\n\nNow, we need to find the factors of 32. The possible pairs of factors are (1, 32), (2, 16), and (4, 8). Since the width is twice the length and twice the height, we can eliminate the first pair (1, 32) because neither 1 nor 32 is twice the other. The second pair (2, 16) also doesn't work because neither 2 nor 16 is twice the other. The third pair (4, 8) works because 8 is twice 4.\n\nSo, x = 4 and y = 8. Then, the width of the foil-covered prism is 2x+2 = 2(4)+2 = 8+2 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is {10}.",

In this case, time = 190 miles / 100 mph = 1.9 hours.\n\nSo, at 2:00 pm + 1.9 hours = 3:54 pm, the cars pass each other.\n\nNow, let's find out how long it takes for them to be 35 miles apart after passing each other. Since they are now moving away from each other, we can still use their combined speed of 100 mph.\n\nUsing the same formula, time = distance/speed, we get time = 35 miles / 100 mph = 0.35 hours.\n\nNow, let's add this time to the time when they passed each other: 3:54 pm + 0.35 hours = 4:15 pm.\n\nSo, the cars are moving away from each other and 35 miles apart at 4:15 pm.\n\nThe final answer is {D) 4:15 pm}.",

Let y be the number of passengers with round-trip tickets. Then, 0.80y passengers held round-trip tickets but did not take their cars abroad the ship.\n\nNow, we can write an equation to represent the total number of passengers with round-trip tickets:\n\ny = 0.20x + 0.80y\n\nWe want to find the percent of the ship's passengers that held round-trip tickets, which is (y/x) * 100.\n\nTo find y in terms of x, we can rearrange the equation:\n\n0.20y = 0.20x - 0.80y\n1.00y = 1.00x\ny = x\n\nSo, the number of passengers with round-trip tickets is equal to the total number of passengers on the ship.

We can see that the sequence alternates between positive and negative numbers, and the absolute value of each term increases by 1. \n\nTo find the first 200 terms, we can split the sequence into two parts: positive terms and negative terms. \n\nFor positive terms, we have 1, 3, 5, ..., 199. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. To find the sum of this sequence, we can use the formula:\n\nSum = (n * (first term + last term)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms in the sequence. Since there are 200 terms in total and every other term is positive, there are 100 positive terms. So, n = 100. \n\nSum of positive terms = (100 * (1 + 199)) / 2 = (100 * 200) / 2 = 10000\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the negative terms. The negative terms are -2, -4, -6, ..., -200. We can find the sum of the absolute values of these terms first, and then make the sum negative. The absolute values form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2: 2, 4, 6, ..., 200. There are 100 terms in this sequence as well. \n\nSum of absolute values of negative terms = (100 * (2 + 200)) / 2 = (100 * 202) / 2 = 10100\n\nSince the negative terms are all negative, the sum of the negative terms is -10100.\n\nNow, we can find the sum of the first 200 terms of the sequence by adding the sum of the positive terms and the sum of the negative terms:\n\nSum of first 200 terms = 10000 + (-10100) = -100\n\nFinally, we can find the average of the first 200 terms by dividing the sum by the number of terms:\n\nAverage = (-100) / 200 = -1/2\n\nSo, the average of the first 200 terms of the sequence is -1/2. \n\nThe final answer is {A}.",

            "Response": "First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. We know that 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

Since the train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of train = Speed of train * Time taken to pass the man\nLength of train = 15 m/s * 20 s = 300 m\n\nNext, let's find the time taken by the train to pass the platform alone (without the man). We know that the train passes the platform and the man in 35 seconds, so the time taken to pass the platform alone is:\n\nTime taken to pass platform alone = Time taken to pass platform and man - Time taken to pass man\nTime taken to pass platform alone = 35 s - 20 s = 15 s\n\nNow, we can find the length of the platform using the formula:\n\nLength of platform = (Speed of train * Time taken to pass platform alone) - Length of train\nLength of platform = (15 m/s * 15 s) - 300 m = 225 m\n\nSo, the length of the platform is 225 meters.

            "Response": "First, let's find out the coal consumption rate of the engines.\n\nSince 3 engines of the former type consume as much as 4 engines of the latter type, we can set up a proportion:\n\n3 engines (former type) / 4 engines (latter type) = Coal consumption (former type) / Coal consumption (latter type)\n\nLet x be the coal consumption of the latter type of engine. Then, the coal consumption of the former type of engine is 4x/3.\n\nNow, we know that 9 engines of the former type consume 24 metric tonnes of coal in 8 hours. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n9 engines * (4x/3) * 8 hours = 24 metric tonnes\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 3 metric tonnes\n\nNow, we know that each engine of the latter type consumes 3 metric tonnes of coal in 8 hours. We want to find out how much coal 8 engines of the latter type will consume in 13 hours.\n\n8 engines * 3 metric tonnes * (13 hours / 8 hours) = 8 * 3 * 13/8 = 39 metric tonnes\n\nSo, 8 engines of the latter type will consume 39 metric tonnes of coal in 13 hours.\n\nThe answer is {39}.",

            "Response": "First, let's find out how long it takes for the man to walk one way. We know that he can walk both ways in 7 3/4 hours. So, to find the time it takes to walk one way, we can divide this time by 2:\n\n7 3/4 \u00f7 2 = (7 + 3/4) \u00f7 2 = (28/4 + 3/4) \u00f7 2 = 31/4 \u00f7 2 = 31/8\n\nSo, it takes 31/8 hours for the man to walk one way.\n\nNow, we know that the man walks a certain distance and rides back in 6 1/4 hours. Since we know that it takes 31/8 hours for him to walk one way, we can find out how long it takes for him to ride back by subtracting the walking time from the total time:\n\n6 1/4 - 31/8 = (6 + 1/4) - 31/8 = (24/4 + 1/4) - 31/8 = 25/4 - 31/8 = (25/4) \u00d7 (2/2) - 31/8 = 50/8 - 31/8 = 19/8\n\nSo, it takes 19/8 hours for the man to ride back.\n\nNow, we want to find out how long it would take for the man to ride both ways. Since it takes 19/8 hours for him to ride back, it would take the same amount of time for him to ride the other way. So, we can find the total time by multiplying the riding time by 2:\n\n19/8 \u00d7 2 = 19/4\n\nSo, it would take 19/4 hours for the man to ride both ways. Converting this to a mixed number, we get:\n\n19/4 = 4 + 3/4 = 4 3/4\n\nSo, the final answer is {4 3/4 hours}.",

We know that the circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. \n\nFor tank A, we have C = 12 meters. So, 12 = 2\u03c0r_A. Solving for r_A, we get r_A = 12 / (2\u03c0) = 6/\u03c0 meters.\n\nFor tank B, we have C = 10 meters. So, 10 = 2\u03c0r_B. Solving for r_B, we get r_B = 10 / (2\u03c0) = 5/\u03c0 meters.\n\nNow, we need to find the volume of each tank. The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nFor tank A, we have r_A = 6/\u03c0 meters and h_A = 10 meters. So, V_A = \u03c0(6/\u03c0)^2 * 10 = (36/\u03c0) * 10 = 360/\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\nFor tank B, we have r_B = 5/\u03c0 meters and h_B = 12 meters.

            "Response": "First, let's find the total age of all 19 persons. Since the average age is 15 years, the total age is 19 * 15 = 285 years.\n\nNow, let's find the total age of the 5 persons with an average age of 14 years. The total age of these 5 persons is 5 * 14 = 70 years.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the total age of the 9 persons with an average age of 16 years. The total age of these 9 persons is 9 * 16 = 144 years.\n\nNow, let's subtract the total ages of these 14 persons (5 + 9) from the total age of all 19 persons to find the total age of the remaining 5 persons (19 - 14 = 5). So, the total age of the remaining 5 persons is 285 - 70 - 144 = 71 years.\n\nSince there are 5 persons left, and we want to find the age of the 15th person, we can assume that the other 4 persons have the same age as the 15th person. Let's call the age of the 15th person x.\n\nSo, the total age of the remaining 5 persons is 4x + x = 5x = 71 years.\n\nNow, we can solve for x: 5x = 71, which means x = 71 / 5 = 14.2 years.\n\nSince age is usually expressed in whole numbers, we can round the age of the 15th person to the nearest whole number, which is 14 years.\n\nSo, the age of the 15th person is approximately 14 years.

So, the rate at which the cistern is filled is V/9 liters per hour.\n\nWhen there is a leak, it takes 10 hours to fill the cistern. So, the rate at which the cistern is filled in this case is V/10 liters per hour.\n\nNow, let's consider the leak. The difference in the filling rates with and without the leak is due to the leak itself. So, the rate at which the leak empties the cistern is (V/9 - V/10) liters per hour.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the leak to empty the full cistern, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Volume / Rate\n\nIn this case, the volume is V liters and the rate is (V/9 - V/10) liters per hour. So, the time it takes for the leak to empty the cistern is:\n\nTime = V / (V/9 - V/10)\n\nTo solve this, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\nTime = V / (10V/90 - 9V/90)\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions:\n\nTime = V / (V/90)\n\nFinally, we can cancel out the V terms:\n\nTime = 90 hours\n\nSo, the leak will take 90 hours to empty the full cistern.

To do this, we need to find 10% of the current price (65% of the original price) and subtract it from the current price. So, 10% of 65% is (10/100) * 65 = 6.5%. Therefore, the price after the second reduction is 65% - 6.5% = 58.5% of the original price.\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage increase needed to restore the price to its original amount. To do this, we need to find the difference between the original price (100%) and the current price (58.5%), which is 100% - 58.5% = 41.5%. \n\nFinally, we need to find what percentage of the current price (58.5%) this difference (41.5%) represents.

            "Response": "First, we need to find out how many monster books Yukou has. Since the ratio of monster books to space travel books is 4:5, and he has 20 space travel books, we can set up a proportion:\n\n4/5 = x/20\n\nTo solve for x (the number of monster books), we can cross-multiply:\n\n5x = 4 * 20\n5x = 80\nx = 16\n\nSo, Yukou has 16 monster books.\n\nNow, we know that Yukou wants to read a book every week for a year, which means he needs 52 books in total. He already has 16 monster books and 20 space travel books, which is a total of 36 books. Therefore, he needs to buy 52 - 36 = 16 more books.\n\nTo maintain the 4:5 ratio, we can set up another proportion:\n\n4/5 = m/(16 - m)\n\nWhere m is the number of monster books he needs to buy. Cross-multiplying, we get:\n\n5m = 4 * (16 - m)\n\nExpanding and solving for m:\n\n5m = 64 - 4m\n9m = 64\nm = 64 / 9 \u2248 7.11\n\nSince Yukou can't buy a fraction of a book, he needs to buy 8 monster books.\n\nNow, let's find out how many space travel books he needs to buy. We can use the same proportion:\n\n4/5 = 8/(s + 20)\n\nWhere s is the number of space travel books he needs to buy. Cross-multiplying, we get:\n\n4 * (s + 20) = 5 * 8\n4s + 80 = 40\n\nSolving for s:\n\n4s = -40\ns = -10\n\nSince the number of space travel books is negative, it means that Yukou doesn't need to buy any more space travel books. However, this doesn't maintain the 4:5 ratio. To maintain the ratio, he needs to buy 10 space travel books.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n{B)8 monster, 10 space}",

We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, let's consider the number of ways to distribute the 5 cards among the 3 envelopes. We can use stars and bars method for this. We have 5 cards (stars) and 2 dividers (bars) to separate them into 3 groups. So, we have a total of 7 positions to place the stars and bars. We can choose any 2 of these positions for the bars, so there are C(7,2) = 21 ways to distribute the cards among the envelopes.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of distinct sets we can form from these distributions. For each distribution, we can find the product of the cards in each envelope and sort them in increasing order. Since the cards have distinct prime numbers, the products will also be distinct. So, for each of the 21 distributions, we can form a unique set.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the cases where the envelopes have the same numbers. For example, if two envelopes have the same number, then the third envelope must have the product of all 5 prime numbers. There are 3 ways to choose which envelope has the product of all 5 prime numbers, and the other two envelopes will have the same number. So, we have 3 sets with two envelopes having the same number.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the case where all three envelopes have the same number. This is only possible if all three envelopes have the number 1, which is the product of no cards. This gives us 1 set with all three envelopes having the same number.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct sets is 21 (unique sets from distributions) - 3 (sets with two envelopes having the same number) + 1 (set with all three envelopes having the same number) = 19.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 19, which is not among the given options.

            "Response": "First, let's convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. We know that 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hr = 3600 s. So, 54 km/hr = (54 * 1000) / 3600 = 15 m/s.\n\nNow, let's find the length of the train. Since the train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of train = Speed of train * Time taken to pass the man\nLength of train = 15 m/s * 20 s = 300 m\n\nNext, let's find the time taken by the train to pass the platform alone (without the man). Since the train takes 36 seconds to pass the entire platform (including the man), and it takes 20 seconds to pass the man, the time taken to pass the platform alone is:\n\nTime taken to pass platform = Time taken to pass platform and man - Time taken to pass man\nTime taken to pass platform = 36 s - 20 s = 16 s\n\nNow, we can find the length of the platform using the formula:\n\nLength of platform = Speed of train * Time taken to pass platform\nLength of platform = 15 m/s * 16 s = 240 m\n\nSo, the length of the platform is 240 meters.

So, the new average age of the group is (x+2).\n\nSince there are now 8 people in the group (6 men and 2 women), the total age of the group after the replacement is 8(x+2).\n\nNow, let's find the total age of the two women. The total age of the group remains the same after the replacement, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n8x = 8(x+2) - 20 - 10\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n8x = 8x + 16 - 30\n0 = 16 - 30\nx = 14\n\nSo, the average age of the 8 men before the replacement is 14 years.\n\nNow, let's find the total age of the two women. We can use the equation we found earlier:\n\n8x = 8(x+2) - 20 - 10\n8(14) = 8(14+2) - 20 - 10\n112 = 8(16) - 30\n112 = 128 - 30\nTotal age of the two women = 112 - 98 = 14\n\nNow, let's find the average age of the two women.

Since each share was sold for 24 dollars, the total selling price is:\n\n100 shares * 24 dollars/share = $2400\n\nNext, let's calculate the brokerage fees. The investor paid a 2% fee on both the total purchase price and the total selling price. So the fees are:\n\nPurchase fee = 2% * $812.50 = 0.02 * 812.50 = $16.25\nSelling fee = 2% * $2400 = 0.02 * 2400 = $48\n\nNow, let's find the net purchase price and net selling price by subtracting the fees:\n\nNet purchase price = $812.50 - $16.25 = $796.25\nNet selling price = $2400 - $48 = $2352\n\nNow we can find the gain by subtracting the net purchase price from the net selling price:\n\nGain = $2352 - $796.25 = $1555.75\n\nFinally, let's find the percent gain by dividing the gain by the net purchase price and multiplying by 100:\n\nPercent gain = ($1555.75 / $796.25) * 100 \u2248 195%\n\nThe closest answer choice to 195% is 190%, so the answer is C) 190%.",

            "Response": "1. We know that the difference between the length and breadth of the rectangle is 10 m. Let's denote the length as L and the breadth as B. So, L - B = 10.\n\n2. We also know that the perimeter of the rectangle is 206 m. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(L + B). So, 206 = 2(L + B).\n\n3. Now, we have two equations with two variables (L and B):\n\n   a) L - B = 10\n   b) 2(L + B) = 206\n\n4. Let's solve these equations to find the values of L and B. First, we can simplify equation b:\n\n   2L + 2B = 206\n   L + B = 103\n\n5. Now, we can add equation a and the simplified equation b:\n\n   (L - B) + (L + B) = 10 + 103\n   2L = 113\n   L = 56.5\n\n6. Now that we have the value of L, we can find the value of B using equation a:\n\n   56.5 - B = 10\n   B = 56.5 - 10\n   B = 46.5\n\n7. Now that we have the values of L and B, we can find the area of the rectangle. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = L * B:\n\n   A = 56.5 * 46.5\n   A = 2624.25\n\n8. Since the given options are all in whole numbers, we can round the area to the nearest whole number:\n\n   A \u2248 2624\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is approximately 2624 m^2.

The absolute value of a number is the distance between the number and zero on the number line. In this case, the absolute value of 4 is 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the product of the local value and absolute value of 4.

So, in one day, they can finish 1/14 of the work.\n\nIn one day, A can finish 1/x of the work and B can finish 1/y of the work. So, together they can finish (1/x + 1/y) of the work in one day.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n1/x + 1/y = 1/14\n\nNow, we can substitute x = y/2 in the equation:\n\n1/(y/2) + 1/y = 1/14\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2/y + 1/y = 1/14\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n3/y = 1/14\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 3 * 14\n\ny = 42\n\nSo, B can finish the work in 42 days.

            "Response": "First, we need to determine how many ways we can arrange the digits to form a five-digit number. There are 5 choices for the first digit (it cannot be 0), 4 choices for the second digit, 3 choices for the third digit, 2 choices for the fourth digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. So, there are 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 ways to arrange the digits.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many of these arrangements are divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 15, which is divisible by 3. So, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the digits such that the sum of the digits in the five-digit number is also divisible by 3.\n\nWe can do this by considering the possible remainders when the sum of the digits is divided by 3. The possible remainders are 0, 1, and 2. If the remainder is 0, then the sum of the digits in the five-digit number is divisible by 3. If the remainder is 1, then the sum of the digits in the five-digit number is one more than a multiple of 3. If the remainder is 2, then the sum of the digits in the five-digit number is two more than a multiple of 3.\n\nWe can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to find the number of ways to arrange the digits such that the sum of the digits in the five-digit number is divisible by 3.\n\n1. The total number of ways to arrange the digits is 120.\n\n2. The number of ways to arrange the digits such that the sum of the digits in the five-digit number is one more than a multiple of 3 is 40. This is because there are 2 ways to choose the digit with a remainder of 1 (either 1 or 4), and then there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the remaining digits. So, there are 2 * 24 = 48 ways.\n\n3. The number of ways to arrange the digits such that the sum of the digits in the five-digit number is two more than a multiple of 3 is also 40. This is because there are 2 ways to choose the digit with a remainder of 2 (either 2 or 5), and then there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the remaining digits. So, there are 2 * 24 = 48 ways.\n\n4. The number of ways to arrange the digits such that the sum of the digits in the five-digit number is divisible by 3 is 120 - 48 - 48 = 24.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to form a five-digit number divisible by 3 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition is 24.

            "Response": "First, let's consider the structure of the large cube. It is made up of 27 smaller cubes arranged in a 3x3x3 formation. \n\nNow, let's think about the smaller cubes that have 2 faces painted. These cubes must be on an edge of the large cube, but not on a corner. There are 12 edges on a cube, and each edge has 3 smaller cubes. However, the corner cubes are counted twice in this calculation (once for each edge they are a part of), so we need to subtract the 8 corner cubes from the total.\n\nSo, the number of cubes with 2 faces painted is (12 edges * 3 cubes per edge) - 8 corner cubes = 36 - 8 = 28 cubes.\n\nHowever, we have counted the cubes with 3 faces painted twice (once for each pair of adjacent faces), so we need to subtract the 8 cubes with 3 faces painted from the total.\n\nSo, the final number of cubes with 2 faces painted is 28 - 8 = 20 cubes.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our calculation. We counted the cubes with 1 face painted as having 2 faces painted. There are 6 faces on a cube, and each face has 9 smaller cubes. However, the edge and corner cubes are counted multiple times in this calculation, so we need to subtract the 12 edge cubes and the 8 corner cubes from the total.\n\nSo, the number of cubes with 1 face painted is (6 faces * 9 cubes per face) - 12 edge cubes - 8 corner cubes = 54 - 12 - 8 = 34 cubes.\n\nNow, we can correct our previous calculation for the number of cubes with 2 faces painted by subtracting the number of cubes with 1 face painted from the total.\n\nSo, the final number of cubes with 2 faces painted is 20 - 34 = -14 cubes.\n\nHowever, this answer doesn't make sense, as we cannot have a negative number of cubes. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's try a different approach.\n\nConsider the large cube again. The cubes with 2 faces painted must be on an edge of the large cube, but not on a corner. There are 4 edges on the top face, 4 edges on the bottom face, and 4 vertical edges connecting the top and bottom faces. Each of these edges has 1 cube with 2 faces painted (the middle cube of the edge).\n\nSo, the number of cubes with 2 faces painted is (4 top edges + 4 bottom edges + 4 vertical edges) * 1 cube per edge = 12 cubes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 12 cubes, which is option A.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is {A}.",

Since tap B can fill the tank in 20 minutes, in 1 minute it will fill 1/20 or 5% of the tank.\n\nSince 50% of the tank is already filled by tap A, we need to fill the remaining 50% of the tank with tap B. To find out how long it will take for tap B to fill the remaining 50%, we can set up a proportion:\n\n5% of the tank in 1 minute = 50% of the tank in x minutes\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply and divide:\n\n(5% * x minutes) = (1 minute * 50%)\n\n(5% * x minutes) = 50 minutes\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5%:\n\nx minutes = 50 minutes / 5%\n\nx minutes = 10 minutes\n\nSo, it will take tap B 10 more minutes to fill the remaining 50% of the tank.\n\nThe final answer is {10 minutes}.",

            "Response": "First, let's find the point P that minimizes the sum of the distances to (8,0) and (0,12). To do this, we can use the triangle inequality, which states that for any three points A, B, and C, the sum of the distances between A and B and between B and C is greater than or equal to the distance between A and C. In other words, the shortest path between two points is a straight line.\n\nLet A = (8,0), B = (0,12), and C = P. Then, we want to minimize the sum of the distances AC and BC. By the triangle inequality, this sum is greater than or equal to the distance AB. The distance AB is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 8 and 12, which is 4*sqrt(13) by the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nNow, we want to find the points P in set S that achieve this minimum sum of distances. Since the shortest path between two points is a straight line, the points P that achieve this minimum sum of distances must lie on the line segment connecting A and B. This line segment has a slope of -12/8 = -3/2 and passes through the points (8,0) and (0,12). Thus, its equation is y = -3/2x + 12.\n\nWe now need to find the points with integer coordinates that lie on this line. To do this, we can plug in integer values of x and see if we get integer values of y. If x = 0, we get y = 12. If x = 2, we get y = 9. If x = 4, we get y = 6. If x = 6, we get y = 3. If x = 8, we get y = 0. These are all the integer values of x that give integer values of y, so there are 5 such points P in set S.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }5}$.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the total number of arrangements of the letters in the word MEDITERRANEAN. There are 13 letters in the word, but some of them are repeated. There are 2 M's, 3 E's, 2 R's, 2 A's, and 2 N's. So, the total number of arrangements is:\n\n13! / (2! * 3! * 2! * 2! * 2!) = 6,227,020 / (2 * 6 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 1,038,670\n\nNow, let's find the number of arrangements with E as the first letter and R as the last letter. We are left with 11 letters to arrange, with the same repetitions as before, except now there are only 2 E's and 1 R:\n\n11! / (2! * 2! * 2! * 2!) = 39,916,800 / (2 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 4,989,600\n\nNow, we can find the probability Q by dividing the number of arrangements with E as the first letter and R as the last letter by the total number of arrangements:\n\nQ = 4,989,600 / 1,038,670 \u2248 1/20\n\nSo, the probability Q is approximately 1/20. The correct answer is B) 1/20.\n\nFinal answer: {B}",

            "Response": "First, we know that the multiplication of the first 3 prime numbers is 385. Let's call these prime numbers p1, p2, and p3. So, we have:\n\np1 * p2 * p3 = 385\n\nNow, we know that the multiplication of the last 3 prime numbers is 1001. Let's call these prime numbers p2, p3, and p4 (since they are in ascending order). So, we have:\n\np2 * p3 * p4 = 1001\n\nWe can see that p2 and p3 are common in both equations. So, we can divide the second equation by the first equation to eliminate p2 and p3:\n\n(p2 * p3 * p4) / (p1 * p2 * p3) = 1001 / 385\n\np4 / p1 = 1001 / 385\n\nNow, we need to find the prime numbers that multiply to 385 and 1001. Let's find the prime factors of both numbers:\n\n385 = 5 * 7 * 11\n1001 = 7 * 11 * 13\n\nFrom the prime factorization, we can see that p1 = 5, p2 = 7, p3 = 11, and p4 = 13. So, the last number (p4) is:\n\np4 = 13\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{13}",
