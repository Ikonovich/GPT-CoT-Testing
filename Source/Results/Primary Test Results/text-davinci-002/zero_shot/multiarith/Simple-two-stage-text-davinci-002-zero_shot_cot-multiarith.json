If she gave her mother 26 of them, that means that she gave her mother all of the green towels plus some of the white towels. So, we can write that as 5 + some number.\n\nWe also know that the total number of towels that Emily has at the end is 31. So, we can write that as 5 + some number = 31.\n\nNow, we just have to solve for the unknown number, which is the number of white towels that Emily gave to her mother. We can do that by subtracting 5 from each side. When we do that, we get that some number = 26. So, the number of white towels that Emily gave to her mother is 26, and Emily ended up with 31 towels in total.",

Finally, we can put those two pieces of information together to answer the question.  Her team scored 2 points for each player on the team, so they scored 2 times some number.  That number is the number of players on the team minus 1, since we are not counting Emily.  So we have 2 times some number equals 39.  We can solve this equation to find out how many players were on her team.  2 times some number equals 39  2 times some number equals 2 times 19  some number equals 19  some number equals 19  There were 19 players on her team, so Emily's team had 18 players plus Emily.",

        "Response": "\n\nThere are a few ways to solve this problem, but let's start by listing out what we know.\n\n- Paige had 27 files on her computer\n- She deleted 9 of them\n- She put the rest into folders with 6 files in each one\n\nFrom this, we can infer a few things.\n\n- She must have at least 1 folder, because if she didn't, she would have more than 9 files left\n- She can't have more than 4 folders, because if she did, she would have less than 9 files left\n\nSo we know that she has 1, 2, 3, or 4 folders. Let's try each one and see if it works.\n\n- If she has 1 folder, that means she would have 18 files left. 9 + 18 = 27, so this works.\n- If she has 2 folders, that means she would have 12 files left. 9 + 12 = 21, so this doesn't work.\n- If she has 3 folders, that means she would have 6 files left. 9 + 6 = 15, so this doesn't work.\n- If she has 4 folders, that means she would have 0 files left. 9 + 0 = 9, so this doesn't work.\n\nWe can see that the only option that works is if she has 1 folder, so she would have 18 files in that folder.",
