There are no exponents in this equation, so you go to the next step, which is multiplication and division. You multiply 4 * 7 first, which equals 28.

This is the order which can be abbreviated PEMDAS: \n\nP: Parentheses first\nE: Exponents (ie Powers and Square Roots, etc.)\nMD: Multiplication and Division (left-to-right)\nAS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)\n\nIn this equation, there are no parentheses, so you start with the exponents. 8^7 = 5764801. Then, you move on to the multiplication and division, which would be 1 * 9 * 8 = 72. However, because the division sign is after the subtraction sign, you need to do the division first. So 72 / 7 = 10.285714286. Finally, you do the addition and subtraction from left to right, which would give you 5764801 - 10 + 7 + 1 = 116.",

You then multiply 4 by 6 and get 24. You take away the 4 from 24 and you are left with 20. You then multiply 20 by 8 and get 160. You take away the 0 from 160 and you are left with 16.

The explanation is as follows: \n\n8 - 6 + 5 - 3 - 2 + 9 + 6 = 9\n\nThe reason this is the case is because when you have a string of numbers with both positive and negative signs, the order in which you add or subtract them does not matter. This is because addition and subtraction are both commutative and associative. This means that you can add or subtract the numbers in any order and you will still get the same result.",
