In this equation, the parentheses are ignored because there are none. The next operation is exponents, but there are none of those either. So, the next operation is multiplication and division. Multiplication and division are done from left to right, so 7 * 9 is done first, giving 63. Then, 63 is divided by 7, giving 9. The next operation is addition and subtraction, which are also done from left to right. So, -5 is added to 9, giving 4. Finally, 4 is subtracted from -7, giving -3.",

We see that there is a 9 with a superscript of 2, which means that we need to square the 9, or multiply it by itself. 9 * 9 = 81.\n\nNext, we move on to the multiplication and division. We see that there is a 6 with a division symbol in front of it, so we divide 6 by the number in front of it, which is 1. 6 / 1 = 6.\n\nNow we move on to the addition and subtraction. We see that there is a 1 and an 8, so we add those together to get 9. Then we see that there is a 9 and a 6, so we add those together to get 15.
