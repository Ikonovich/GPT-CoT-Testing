This means that the investment will double approximately every 8 years. \n\nSince we know that the investment will double every 8 years, we can set up the following equation: \n\n2^n = 9 \n\nWhere n is the number of doublings that will occur over the 40 year period. \n\nSolving for n, we get: \n\nn = log2(9) \n\nn = 3.16 \n\nSince we know that the investment will double 3 times over the 40 year period, we can set up the following equation: \n\n1*(1+r)^40 = 9 \n\nWhere r is the annual rate of return. \n\nSolving for r, we get: \n\nr = (9/1)^(1/40)-1 \n\nr = 0.225 \n\nr = 22.5% \n\nTherefore, the answer is D)22 1/2 %.",

            "Response": "\n\nThe answer is D)58/3 hrs. \n\nThe reason is as follows: \n\nThe bike takes 1/5th of the time to cross the stretch as compared to the people running. \n\nSo, the time taken by the bike to cross the stretch = 300/5 = 60 hrs \n\nThe time taken by the people running to cross the stretch = 300/10 = 30 hrs \n\nTherefore, the total time taken to cross the stretch = 60 + 30 = 90 hrs \n\nHowever, since the bike is making round trips, the total time taken would be half of this, i.e. 45 hrs. \n\nTherefore, the time taken by the bike to cross the stretch = 45/5 = 9 hrs \n\nThe time taken by the people running to cross the stretch = 45/10 = 4.5 hrs \n\nTherefore, the total time taken = 9 + 4.5 = 13.5 hrs \n\nSince there are 4 people, the total time taken would be 4 times this, i.e. 54 hrs. \n\nTherefore, the time taken to cross the stretch = 54/3 = 18 hrs",

But, if Wednesday were to give Pugsley five of her spiders, Pugsley would now have five fewer spiders than Wednesday had before they traded.\n\nThis can be represented as the equation:\n\n4x - 5y = 0\n\nwhere x represents the number of spiders Pugsley has and y represents the number of spiders Wednesday has.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 5y/4\n\nSince we know that Pugsley has fewer spiders than Wednesday, we can set y > x.\n\nIf y = 9, then x = 6.5. Since Pugsley cannot have a fraction of a spider, we know that y must be greater than 9.\n\nIf y = 10, then x = 7.5. Since Pugsley cannot have a fraction of a spider, we know that y must be greater than 10.\n\nIf y = 11, then x = 8.25. Since Pugsley cannot have a fraction of a spider, we know that y must be greater than 11.\n\nIf y = 12, then x = 9.\n\nSince y must be greater than 12 for Pugsley to have fewer spiders than Wednesday, we can conclude that Pugsley has 8 spiders before the trading game commences.",

This gives us:\n\nx = (32.3 - 15(15))/20\n\nx = (32.3 - 225)/20\n\nx = -192.7/20\n\nx = -9.635\n\nSince we cannot add a negative amount of milk, this means that it is not possible to have a mixture worth Rs.32/3 a litre by adding 15 litres of water to 60 litres of milk at Rs.20 a litre.",

In this problem, we are told that the median is (a+11), which means that a+11 is in the middle of the set when the numbers are listed in order.

            "Response": "\n\nC)2520 m^2\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is equal to 2 times the sum of the length and the width. In this case, the perimeter is 206, so:\n\n2(length + width) = 206\n\nlength + width = 103\n\nThe difference between the length and the width is 10, so:\n\nlength - width = 10\n\nlength = width + 10\n\nSubstituting this value for length in the equation above, we get:\n\n2(width + 10) = 206\n\nwidth + 10 = 103\n\nwidth = 93\n\nNow that we know the width, we can calculate the area. The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of the length and the width. In this case, the area is:\n\narea = length * width\n\narea = (width + 10) * width\n\narea = (93 + 10) * 93\n\narea = 103 * 93\n\narea = 2520",
