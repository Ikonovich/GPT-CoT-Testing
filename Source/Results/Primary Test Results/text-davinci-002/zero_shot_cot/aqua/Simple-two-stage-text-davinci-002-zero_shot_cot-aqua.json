This means that for every 1 km that Friend Q walks, Friend P will walk 1.15 km. \n\nWe are also told that the friends start at opposite ends of the 43-km trail. This means that Friend P starts at km 0, and Friend Q starts at km 43. \n\nWe want to know how many kilometers Friend P will have walked when they pass each other. In other words, we want to know how many kilometers Friend P will have walked when they reach km 43. \n\nWe can set up the following equation: \n\n43 = x + 1.15x \n\nWe can solve this equation for x: \n\nx = 21.5 \n\nThis means that Friend P will have walked 21.5 km when they pass Friend Q. \n\nThe answer is B.",

We know that y > 3 + 2x/3. We also know that x < y (because he sold more bicycles this week than last week). So we have:\n\n3 + 2x/3 < y < y\n\n2x/3 < y - 3 < 0\n\n-2x/3 > -y + 3 > 0\n\n2x/3 > y - 3\n\n2x/3 + 3 > y\n\nx > y\n\nSince x cannot be greater than y, statement II must be false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E) III only.",

            "Response": "\n\nFirst, let's find how long it took her to travel the first half of the journey. We know that she traveled at a rate of 21 km/hr for this part of the journey, so we can use the equation d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate, and t is the time. We know two of these values, so we can solve for t:\n\nt = d/r\nt = 21/21\nt = 1\n\nSo it took her 1 hour to travel the first half of the journey. This means that it took her 19 hours to travel the second half of the journey, since she completed the entire journey in 20 hours.\n\nNow let's find the distance she traveled in the second half of the journey. We can use the same equation, d = rt. We know that she traveled at a rate of 24 km/hr for this part of the journey, and we know that it took her 19 hours, so we can solve for d:\n\nd = rt\nd = 24*19\nd = 456\n\nTherefore, the total distance she traveled was 1 + 456 = 457 km.",

            "Response": "  First, we need to find the total cost of the mixture.  We know that a pound of nuts costs 3 times as much as a pound of raisins.  So, if we multiply the cost of a pound of raisins by 3, we will get the cost of a pound of nuts.  We also know that there are 3 pounds of raisins and 3 pounds of nuts in the mixture.  So, we can multiply the cost of a pound of raisins by 3 and multiply the cost of a pound of nuts by 3 to get the total cost of the mixture.  Now that we have the total cost of the mixture, we can divide it by the total weight of the mixture to get the cost per pound.  We know that the total weight of the mixture is 6 pounds, so we can divide the total cost of the mixture by 6 to get the cost per pound.  Now that we have the cost per pound, we can multiply it by the weight of the raisins to get the total cost of the raisins.  We know that there are 3 pounds of raisins, so we can multiply the cost per pound by 3 to get the total cost of the raisins.  Now that we have the total cost of the raisins, we can divide it by the total cost of the mixture to get the fraction of the total cost that the raisins make up.  The answer is C) 1/4.",

So, we can rewrite 50 and 160 as follows:  50 = 50/800 * 800  160 = 160/800 * 800  Now we can compare the two values:  160/800 * 800  =  (160/800) * (800/1)  =  (160/800) * (800 * 1/800)  =  (160/800) * (1)  =  160/800  50/800 * 800  =  (50/800) * (800/1)  =  (50/800) * (800 * 1/800)  =  (50/800) * (1)  =  50/800  Now we can see that 160/800 is greater than 50/800.  Therefore, 160 is greater than 50.  Since 160 is greater than 50, the answer must be greater than 100%.  Therefore, the answer is D.\n",

We can then use the quadratic equation to solve for b. This gives us the values b = -3/2 or b = 1. However, we know that a and b must be positive integers, so we can eliminate b = -3/2.

Now, we need to find the probability of drawing a king.  There are 4 kings in a deck of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing a king is 4/52.  To find the probability of drawing a diamond or a king, we need to add the probabilities of drawing a diamond and drawing a king.

For example, if we put ball 1 in box 1, ball 2 in box 2, and ball 3 in box 3, this is the same as if we put ball 3 in box 1, ball 1 in box 2, and ball 2 in box 3.

So, Sachin's age + 4 = Rahul's age. We'll substitute this value in 7x:9x to get 7(Sachin's age + 4):9x. Now we have two equations: 7(Rahul's age - 4):9x and 7(Sachin's age + 4):9x. We'll cross multiply to get 63x = 63(Sachin's age + 4). 63x = 63(Sachin's age + 4) 63x/63 = (Sachin's age + 4)/1 63x/63 = Sachin's age + 4 63x/63 - 4 = Sachin's age 59x/63 = Sachin's age.

We can divide both sides of the equation by 60 to find out.  3,600/60 = 60.  60/60 = 1.  So, 1/60 of an hour is equal to 1 second.  The light flashes every 20 seconds, so it will flash 3 times in 1 second.  Therefore, it will flash 3*60 = 180 times in 1 minute, and 180*60 = 10,800 times in 1 hour.  Since we want to know how many times it will flash in 1/60 of an hour, we just divide 10,800 by 60.  10,800/60 = 180.  Therefore, the answer is D.\n",

            "Response": "\n\nThe ratio of the ages of Anil and his son at present is 7:3.\n\nThis means that the ages of Anil and his son are in the ratio of 7 to 3, which is the same as saying that for every 3 years that his son is alive, Anil is alive for 7 years.\n\nWe can use this information to find the present ages of Anil and his son. If we let the present age of Anil be x years, then we can say that the present age of his son is 3x years.\n\nNow, we are told that six years from now, the ratio of the ages of Anil's wife and son will be 2:1. This means that for every 2 years that his wife is alive, his son will be alive for 1 year.\n\nWe can use this information to find the future ages of Anil's wife and son. If we let the future age of Anil's wife be y years, then we can say that the future age of his son will be y/2 years.\n\nWe are also told that the future age of Anil's wife will be 2/1 times the future age of his son. We can use this information to create the equation:\n\ny/2 = 2/1 * y/2\n\ny = 2y\n\ny = 2 * present age of wife\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n3x = y/2\n\ny = 2 * present age of wife\n\nWe can solve for the present age of wife by substituting y/2 for 3x in the second equation:\n\ny/2 = 2 * present age of wife\n\ny = 4 * present age of wife\n\nNow, we can substitute 4 * present age of wife for y in the first equation:\n\n3x = 4 * present age of wife / 2\n\n3x = 2 * present age of wife\n\nx = 2/3 * present age of wife\n\nThis means that the present age of Anil is 2/3 the present age of his wife.\n\nWe can use this information to find the ratio of the present ages of Anil and his wife. If we let the present age of Anil be x years, then we can say that the present age of his wife is 3x years.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the present ages of Anil and his wife is 2:3.",

            "Response": " \n\nFirst, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour to meters per second. We can do this by multiplying 54 km/hr by 1 hr/3600 sec.

This means that the man walks at a faster speed than he rides.\n\nNow, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(Distance) / (Walking Speed) = (Distance) / (Riding Speed)\n\nWe can solve for the walking speed:\n\nWalking Speed = (Distance) / ((Distance) / (Riding Speed))\n\nWalking Speed = Riding Speed\n\nNow, we can plug in the values that we know:\n\nWalking Speed = Riding Speed\n\n7 3\u20444 hours = 6 1\u20444 hours\n\nWalking Speed = 6 1\u20444 hours\n\nRiding Speed = 6 1\u20444 hours\n\nNow, we can solve for the distance:\n\nDistance = (Walking Speed) * (Time)\n\nDistance = (6 1\u20444 hours) * (7 3\u20444 hours)\n\nDistance = 48 hours\n\nThe man walks a certain distance and rides back in 6 1\u20444h.

However, we need to account for the fact that the order of the projects does not matter.  For example, if we have the combination {A,B,C}, this is the same as {A,C,B}.  Therefore, we need to divide 9C3 by 3! to account for the fact that the order does not matter.  Therefore, the number of different ways we can assign 9 employees to 3 projects is 9C3/3!.  We can use the combination formula to calculate this.  9C3/3! = 9!/(3!(9-3)!) = 9!/(3!6!) = (9)(8)(7)/(3)(2)(1) = 84.

So, the number of ways to do this is 5*4*3 = 60.  However, we need to be careful because we are not allowing repetition.  So, we need to divide by the number of ways to choose 1 number from 5 possibilities, 1 number from 4 possibilities, and 1 number from 3 possibilities.  This is 5*4*3*2*1*4*3*2*1*3*2*1 = 5!*4!*3!.
