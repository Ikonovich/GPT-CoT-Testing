This means that we need to solve the equation in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). \n\nWe start by solving the parentheses first. We have two sets of parentheses, (1 * 7) and (6 * 5). We solve the first set of parentheses first, which gives us 7. We then solve the second set of parentheses, which gives us 30. So now we have:\n\n1 * 7 - 7 + 6 * 5 = 7 - 7 + 30\n\nNext, we solve the exponents. We don't have any exponents in this equation, so we move on. \n\nNext, we solve the multiplication and division. We have two multiplication problems, 1 * 7 and 6 * 5. We solve these from left to right, which gives us 7 and 30. So now we have:\n\n7 - 7 + 30 = 7 - 7 + 30\n\nFinally, we solve the addition and subtraction. We have two addition problems, 7 + 30 and 7 - 7. We solve these from left to right, which gives us 37 and 0. So now we have:\n\n7 - 7 + 30 = 37\n\nThis is our final answer.",
