So, the total number of ways to select 2 members from the k-2 members is C(k-2, 2) = (k-2)! / (2!(k-4)!).\n\nNow, we know that there are 6 possible combinations in which Jim and Ellen are not selected. This means that the total number of ways to select 2 members from the k-2 members, minus the combinations with Jim and Ellen, is equal to 6.\n\nSo, we can write the equation: C(k-2, 2) - C(2, 2) = 6.\n\nC(2, 2) is the number of ways to select both Jim and Ellen, which is 1 (since there's only one way to select both of them).

        "Response": "I. x@y = x^2 - xy\nFor this expression to be equal to zero, we need x^2 = xy, which means x = y. So, if x = y, then x@y = 0. This is possible.\n\nII. (xy)@y = (xy)^2 - (xy)y = x^2y^2 - xy^2\nFor this expression to be equal to zero, we need x^2y^2 = xy^2, which means x = y. So, if x = y, then (xy)@y = 0. This is also possible.\n\nIII. x@(x + y) = x^2 - x(x + y) = x^2 - x^2 - xy\nFor this expression to be equal to zero, we need x^2 = x^2 + xy, which means xy = 0. However, we are given that xy \u2260 0, so this is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) I and II.",

        "Query": "Carl is facing very difficult financial times and can only pay the interest on a $10,000 loan he has taken. The bank charges him a quarterly compound rate of 4%. What is the approximate interest he pays annually?\nOptions:  A)$1600 B)$2000 C)$2150 D)$2500 E)$12000  Let's think step by step.",
        "Response": "First, we need to find the interest Carl pays quarterly. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nQuarterly interest = Principal amount * Quarterly interest rate\n\nQuarterly interest = $10,000 * 0.04 = $400\n\nNow, since there are 4 quarters in a year, we can find the annual interest by multiplying the quarterly interest by 4:\n\nAnnual interest = Quarterly interest * 4\n\nAnnual interest = $400 * 4 = $1600\n\nSo, the approximate interest Carl pays annually is $1600. The correct option is A) $1600.",
