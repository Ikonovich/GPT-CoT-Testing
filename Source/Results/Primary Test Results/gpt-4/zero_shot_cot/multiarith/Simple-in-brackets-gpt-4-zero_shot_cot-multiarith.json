        "Response": "First, we need to find out how many apples are left after they handed out 30 to students. We can do this by subtracting 30 from 86: \n\n86 - 30 = 56 apples left.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pies they can make using 56 apples. Since each pie takes 8 apples, we can divide 56 by 8:\n\n56 \u00f7 8 = 7 pies.\n\nSo, they can make 7 pies. The final answer is in squiggly brackets: {7}.",
