            "Response": "{57}\n\nExplanation: Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which stands for Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.\n\n1. Perform the multiplication operations first:\n   6 * 6 = 36\n   4 * 3 = 12\n   7 * 2 = 14\n\n2. Replace the original equation with the results of the multiplication operations:\n   7 + 36 - 12 + 14 + 9\n\n3. Perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:\n   43 - 12 = 31\n   31 + 14 = 45\n   45 + 9 = 57\n\nSo, the final answer is {57}.",
