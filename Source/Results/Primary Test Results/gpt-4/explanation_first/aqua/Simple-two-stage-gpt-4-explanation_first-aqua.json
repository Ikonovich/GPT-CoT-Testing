",
        "Response": "Let x be the distance walked by Friend Q. Then, the distance walked by Friend P is 1.15x. Since they start at opposite ends of the trail, the sum of the distances they walk is equal to the length of the trail, which is 43 km. So, we can write the equation:\n\nx + 1.15x = 43\n\nCombining the terms with x, we get:\n\n2.15x = 43\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 43 / 2.15\nx = 20\n\nSo, Friend Q walks 20 km. To find the distance walked by Friend P, we can use the expression 1.15x:\n\n1.15 * 20 = 23\n\nTherefore, Friend P walks 23 km when they pass each other. The answer is E) 23.",

        "Response": "Let the three parts be A, B, and C. According to the given information, the ratio of A, B, and C is 1/7:1/7:1/14.\n\nTo find the actual values of A, B, and C, we first need to find the LCM of the denominators of the given fractions, which is 14.\n\nNow, we can write the given ratio as 2/14:2/14:1/14.\n\nThe sum of the ratios is (2+2+1)/14 = 5/14.\n\nNow, we can find the value of 1 part by dividing the total amount (Rs. 5600) by the sum of the ratios (5/14).\n\n1 part = 5600 * (14/5) = 1120\n\nNow, we can find the values of A, B, and C by multiplying the value of 1 part with the respective ratios.\n\nA = 2 * 1120 = 2240\nB = 2 * 1120 = 2240\nC = 1 * 1120 = 1120\n\nThe difference between A and C is 2240 - 1120 = 1120.\n\nSo, A is Rs. 1120 more than C. The correct answer is C) 1120.",
