So if Dominique flipped tails, the coin will still be tails up. If Dominique flipped heads, the coin will be heads up.\n\nIf Guillermina flips heads:\n- The coin is still heads up.\n- When Evelin flips the coin, it could either stay heads up or flip to tails up.\n- When Dominique flips the coin, it could either stay heads up (if Evelin flipped heads) or flip to tails up (if Evelin flipped tails).\n- Since Johnny does not flip the coin, the final result will be whatever Dominique left it as.

Since the coin was heads up before Branden flipped it and none of the other people flipped it, we can conclude that the coin is still heads up. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: {Yes}.",
