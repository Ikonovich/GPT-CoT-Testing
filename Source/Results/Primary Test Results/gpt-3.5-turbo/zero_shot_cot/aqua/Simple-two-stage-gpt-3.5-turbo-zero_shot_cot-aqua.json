            "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks before they meet \"x\". This means that Friend P walks the remaining distance of 43-x before they meet. \n\nNow let's use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nWe know that Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's rate. We can represent Friend Q's rate as \"r\" and Friend P's rate as \"1.15r\". \n\nWe also know that they start at the same time and meet somewhere in the middle, so their times will be equal. Let's call this time \"t\". \n\nUsing these variables, we can set up two equations: \n\nFriend Q: \n\nx = rt \n\nFriend P: \n\n43 - x = 1.15rt \n\nNow we can solve for \"x\" by substituting the first equation into the second equation: \n\n43 - rt = 1.15rt \n\n43 = 2.15rt \n\nt = 20 \n\nNow we can plug in \"t\" to find \"x\": \n\nx = rt = 20r \n\nAnd we can plug in both \"t\" and \"x\" to find how far Friend P has walked: \n\n43 - x = 43 - 20r = 23r \n\nSo Friend P has walked 23 kilometers when they pass each other. \n\nThe answer is E) 23.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find out how much interest Carl pays each quarter. We can use the formula for compound interest:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nWhere:\nA = the amount after t years\nP = the principal (initial amount)\nr = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\nn = the number of times the interest is compounded per year\nt = the time in years\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nP = $10,000\nr = 4% = 0.04\nn = 4 (since the interest is compounded quarterly)\nt = 1/4 (since we want to find the interest for one quarter)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = $10,000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*1/4) = $10,100\n\nSo Carl pays $100 in interest for the first quarter.\n\nTo find out how much he pays annually, we need to repeat this calculation for each quarter and add up the results. Alternatively, we can use the formula for the future value of an annuity:\n\nFV = P[(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1]/(r/n)\n\nWhere:\nFV = the future value of the annuity\nP = the periodic payment (in this case, the interest payment)\nr = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)\nn = the number of times the interest is compounded per year\nt = the time in years\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nP = $10,000 x 0.04/4 = $1000 (since Carl can only pay the interest)\nr = 4% = 0.04\nn = 4 (since the interest is compounded quarterly)\nt = 1 (since we want to find the interest for one year)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nFV = $1000[(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*1) - 1]/(0.04/4) = $4162.10\n\nSo Carl pays approximately $4162.10 in interest annually.

So, the new time taken by the pipe to fill the tank is 2x hours. \n\nNow, we need to find the time taken by the leakage to empty the tank. Let's say the leakage can empty the tank in y hours. \n\nWe know that the pipe and the leakage are working against each other. So, we can set up the following equation: \n\n1/x - 1/y = 1/2x \n\nThis equation represents the rate at which the pipe fills the tank (1/x) minus the rate at which the leakage empties the tank (1/y) equals the net rate at which the tank is being filled (1/2x). \n\nNow, we can simplify this equation: \n\n2y - 2x = xy \n\n2y = xy + 2x \n\n2y = x(y + 2) \n\ny + 2 = 2y/x \n\ny = 2x/(y + 2) \n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 2x in the above equation: \n\ny = 2x/(y + 2) \n\ny = 2(2x)/(y + 2 + 2) \n\ny = 4x/(y + 4) \n\ny(y + 4) = 4x \n\ny^2 + 4y - 4x = 0 \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we can solve for y: \n\ny = (-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 16x))/2 \n\ny = -2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 4x) \n\nSince y cannot be negative, we take the positive value: \n\ny = -2 + sqrt(4 + 4x) \n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x (which is the original time taken by the pipe to fill the tank) as a variable: \n\ny = -2 + sqrt(4 + 4x) \n\ny = -2 + 2sqrt(1 + x) \n\ny = 2(sqrt(1 + x) - 1) \n\nTherefore, the time taken by the leakage to empty the tank is 2(sqrt(1 + x) - 1) hours. \n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x (which is the original time taken by the pipe to fill the tank) from the given information: \n\nx = a hours \n\n2x = 2a hours \n\ny = 2(sqrt(1 + a) - 1) hours \n\nTherefore, the answer is option C) 90 min.",

Using the information given, we can create a probability table:\n\n|          | Bagel | Coffee | Both |\n|----------|-------|--------|------|\n| Probability | 3/5   | 5/7    | ?    |\n\nTo find the probability of both, we can use the fact that \"some customers bought both\" and the formula:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nLet A be the event that a customer bought a bagel and B be the event that a customer bought a coffee. Then:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\nP(A or B) = 3/5 + 5/7 - ?\n\nTo find the probability of A and B, we can use the fact that \"some customers bought both\" and the formula:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A or B)\n\nP(A and B) = 3/5 + 5/7 - (some customers bought both)\n\nWe don't know the probability of both, but we can use the fact that the total probability must add up to 1:\n\nP(A) + P(B) + P(both) = 1\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n\n3/5 + 5/7 + P(both) = 1\nP(both) = 1 - 3/5 - 5/7\nP(both) = 27/35 - 25/35\nP(both) = 2/35\n\nNow we can find the probability of A or B:\n\nP(A or B) = 3/5 + 5/7 - P(A and B)\nP(A or B) = 3/5 + 5/7 - 2/35\nP(A or B) = 27/35\n\nThis means that the probability of a customer buying a bagel or a coffee (or both) is 27/35.\n\nTo find the probability that at least 1 customer bought a coffee and a bagel out of 8 customers, we can use the complement rule:\n\nP(at least 1 customer bought both) = 1 - P(no customer bought both)\n\nTo find the probability that no customer bought both, we can use the fact that the customers are selected independently and the formula for the probability of independent events:\n\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)\n\nLet A be the event that a customer did not buy a bagel and B be the event that a customer did not buy a coffee. Then:\n\nP(no customer bought both) = P(A and B)^8\nP(no customer bought both) = (2/5 * 2/7)^8\nP(no customer bought both) = 256/78125\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that at least 1 customer bought a coffee and a bagel:\n\nP(at least 1 customer bought both) = 1 - P(no customer bought both)\nP(at least 1 customer bought both) = 1 - 256/78125\nP(at least 1 customer bought both) = 77869/78125\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 199/245.",

            "Response": "First, we can simplify the equation by breaking it into three cases based on the signs of the absolute values:\n\nCase 1: x+3 and 4-x are both non-negative\nIn this case, the equation becomes (x+3) - (4-x) = 8+x, which simplifies to 2x+7 = 8+x.

We don't know x yet, but we can figure it out later. \n\nNext, we need to figure out how much of the $1.24 was for the additional miles driven. We can set up another equation:\n\n0.06y = cost of additional miles driven\n\nwhere y is the number of times the man drove an additional 1/5 mile. Again, we don't know y yet, but we can figure it out later. \n\nNow we can set up an equation for the total cost:\n\n0.34x + 0.06y = 1.24\n\nWe have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for x and y. Let's start with x:\n\n0.34x = cost of first 1/4 mile\n0.34x = 1/4 * 0.34\nx = 1\n\nSo the man drove 1/4 mile and paid $0.34 for it. Now let's solve for y:\n\n0.34 + 0.06y = 1.24\n0.06y = 0.9\ny = 15\n\nSo the man drove an additional 15 * 1/5 = 3 miles and paid $0.06 * 15 = $0.90 for it. \n\nAdding up the cost of the first 1/4 mile and the additional 3 miles, we get:\n\n$0.34 + $0.90 = $1.24\n\nSo the man drove a total of 1/4 + 3 = 3.25 miles. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C)3.25.",

So, together they can build 13.5 meters of the wall per day.\n\nTo complete the 90-meter wall, they need 90/13.5 = 6.67 days.

We know that during this time, the train travels the length of the platform plus its own length. So:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = 15 m/s x 32 s\ndistance = 480 m\n\nThis means that the length of the platform plus the length of the train is 480 meters.

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the total volume of milk and water in the first jar.\nLet's assume that the first jar contains 5x units of milk and 4x units of water. Therefore, the total volume of the first jar is 9x units.\nStep 2: Find the total volume of milk and water in the second jar.\nLet's assume that the second jar contains 2y units of milk and y units of water. Therefore, the total volume of the second jar is 3y units.\nStep 3: Find the total volume of milk and water in the third jar.\nSince the third jar has a milk to water ratio of 1:1, we can assume that it contains 15 units of milk and 15 units of water.\nStep 4: Find the amount of milk needed from the first jar.\nTo fill up the third jar with 15 units of milk, we need to take out 10 units of milk from the first jar (since the first jar has a milk to water ratio of 5:4, we need to take out twice as much milk as water to get a 1:1 ratio).\nStep 5: Find the amount of water needed from the second jar.\nTo fill up the third jar with 15 units of water, we need to take out 12 units of water from the second jar (since the second jar has a milk to water ratio of 2:1, we need to take out twice as much water as milk to get a 1:1 ratio).\nStep 6: Check if the total volume taken out from both jars is less than or equal to 30 liters.\nThe total volume taken out from the first jar is 10 units, which is equal to 10/9 times the total volume of the first jar. Therefore, the total volume taken out from the first jar is (10/9)*x liters. \nThe total volume taken out from the second jar is 12 units, which is equal to 4 times the total volume of milk in the second jar. Therefore, the total volume taken out from the second jar is 4*2y = 8y liters.\nTo fill up the third jar, we need to take out a total of 10+12 = 22 units of milk and water. Therefore, the total volume taken out from both jars is (10/9)*x + 8y liters.\nWe don't know the values of x and y, but we can use the ratios to find a relationship between them. Since the first jar has a milk to water ratio of 5:4, we can assume that 5x/9 = volume of milk in the third jar and 4x/9 = volume of water in the third jar. Similarly, since the second jar has a milk to water ratio of 2:1, we can assume that 2y/3 = volume of milk in the third jar and y/3 = volume of water in the third jar. \nSince the third jar has a milk to water ratio of 1:1, we can set the volume of milk in the third jar equal to the volume of water in the third jar and solve for x and y.\n5x/9 = 2y/3\nx/y = 6/5\nTherefore, we can assume that x = 6k and y = 5k for some value of k.\nSubstituting these values in the expression for the total volume taken out from both jars, we get:\n(10/9)*6k + 8*5k = (80/3)*k\nSince (80/3)*k is less than 30 for any value of k, we can conclude that it is possible to take out the required volumes from both jars to fill up the third jar with a milk to water ratio of 1:1.\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 7.5 liters.",

            "Response": "First, we need to determine the possible values of E. The sum of the digits of a 5-digit integer can range from 1 (if all digits are 1) to 45 (if all digits are 9). Since we want an odd sum, the possible values of E are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\nFor E = 1, there is only one 5-digit integer with a digit sum of 1, namely 10000.\n\nFor E = 3, we can choose the first digit to be any odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), and the remaining four digits can be any digit (0-9). There are 5 choices for the first digit and 10 choices for each of the remaining four digits, so there are 5*10^4 integers with a digit sum of 3.\n\nFor E = 5, we can choose the first digit to be any odd number, and the second digit to be any even number (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

The remaining two digits can be any digit. There are 5 choices for the first digit, 5 choices for the second digit, 5 choices for the third digit, and 10 choices for each of the remaining two digits, so there are 5*5*5*10^2 integers with a digit sum of 7.\n\nFor E = 9, we can choose the first digit to be any odd number, the second digit to be any even number, the third digit to be any odd number, and the fourth digit to be any even number.

There are 5 choices for the first digit, 5 choices for the second digit, 5 choices for the third digit, 5 choices for the fourth digit, and 5 choices for the last digit, so there are 5*5*5*5*5 = 5^5 integers with a digit sum of 9.\n\nAdding up the number of integers for each possible value of E, we get:\n\n1 + 5*10^4 + 5*5*10^3 + 5*5*5*10^2 + 5^5 = 9*10^4\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }9\\cdot 10^4}$.",

            "Response": "First, let's consider two circles. The maximum number of points they can intersect is 2 (unless they are the same circle, in which case they intersect at every point on the circle).\n\nNext, let's consider three circles. Each pair of circles can intersect at most 2 points, so the maximum number of points of intersection for three circles is 6. However, it is possible for all three circles to intersect at a single point, which would give a total of 7 points of intersection.\n\nFor four circles, we can start by considering the worst case scenario where each pair of circles intersects at 2 points. This would give a total of 2+2+2+2=8 points of intersection. However, it is possible for all four circles to intersect at a single point, which would give a total of 1+2+2+2=7 points of intersection.\n\nAs we add more circles, the maximum number of points of intersection will depend on the specific arrangement of the circles. However, we can make an educated guess that the maximum number of points of intersection will occur when all circles intersect at a single point. In this case, each circle will intersect every other circle at two points, giving a total of 2*(15-1)=28 points of intersection. However, we need to add the single point where all circles intersect, giving a final answer of 29 points of intersection.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }110}$.",

            "Response": "Let's assume that the vessel initially contains 8 units of the liquid (since there are 3 parts water and 5 parts syrup, the total number of parts is 8). Therefore, there are 3 units of water and 5 units of syrup in the vessel.\n\nLet's say we draw off x units of the mixture and replace it with water. After this process, there will be 3 units of water and 5 units of syrup in the vessel, just like before. However, the total amount of liquid in the vessel will be slightly less due to the removal of x units.\n\nThe amount of water in the new mixture is 1/2 of the total amount of liquid, so we can set up the equation:\n\n3 = (1/2)(8-x+x/8)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n6 = 8 + x/8\n\nx/8 = -2\n\nx = -16\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since we can't remove a negative amount of liquid from the vessel. Therefore, we made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet's try setting up the equation again, but this time using the fact that the amount of syrup in the new mixture is also 1/2 of the total amount of liquid:\n\n5 = (1/2)(8-x+7x/8)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n10 = 8 + 3x/8\n\n3x/8 = 2\n\nx = 16/3\n\nThis is a positive value, so it makes sense. Therefore, we need to draw off 16/3 units of the mixture and replace it with water. To check our answer, we can calculate the new amounts of water and syrup in the vessel:\n\nNew amount of water = 3 - (16/3)/8 + 16/3 = 5/3\n\nNew amount of syrup = 5 - (16/3)*(5/8) = 7/3\n\nThese values satisfy the condition that the mixture is half water and half syrup.

Let's choose quotient = 4, for example:\n\n25 \u00d7 4 + 6 = 106\n\nTherefore, the dividend is 106. Answer: E)106.",

So they spent $\\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}x$ on maintenance. \n\nTo find out what fraction of the original revenues Company Z had left after marketing and maintenance expenditures, we need to subtract the amount spent on marketing and maintenance from the original revenues: \n\n$x - \\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}x$\n\nSimplifying this expression: \n\n$x\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{3}{28}\\right) = x\\left(\\frac{7}{28} - \\frac{3}{28}\\right) = x\\left(\\frac{4}{28}\\right) = \\frac{1}{7}x$\n\nSo Company Z had $\\frac{1}{7}x$ of the original revenues left after marketing and maintenance expenditures. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 9/14.",

Then we know that:\n\nX = 130,000 + (p/100)*130,000\nX = 130,000*(1 + p/100)\n\nIn year 2001, the number of livestock decreased by q%. So the number of livestock at the end of year 2001 is:\n\nY = X - (q/100)*X\nY = X*(1 - q/100)\nY = 130,000*(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100)\n\nWe know that Y = 130,000, so we can set up the equation:\n\n130,000 = 130,000*(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1 = (1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100)\n\nExpanding the brackets, we get:\n\n1 = 1 - (p/100)*(q/100) - p/100 + q/100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n0 = -(p/100)*(q/100) + q/100 - p/100\n\nFactoring out q/100, we get:\n\n0 = (q/100)*(1 - p/100)\n\nSo either q/100 = 0 (which would mean there was no decrease in year 2001, which we know is not true), or 1 - p/100 = 0. Solving for p, we get:\n\np/100 = 1\np = 100\n\nSo we know that p = 100, which means that the correct answer is:\n\nD) p > q",

One and a half hours later, they are again 40 miles apart, driving away from each other. If Otto drives at a speed of x miles per hour, then, in terms of x, Han drives at a speed of how many miles per hour?\nOptions:  A)a) 80-x B)b) 53.33-x C)c) 80-2x D)d) 120-x E)e) 40-x/2  Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, we need to find the total distance they travel in the first 1.5 hours when they are driving towards each other. Since they are driving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds, which is x + y (where y is Han's speed). Therefore, the total distance they travel towards each other in 1.5 hours is (x + y) * 1.5 = 1.5x + 1.5y.\n\nNext, we need to find the total distance they travel in the next 1.5 hours when they are driving away from each other. Since they are driving away from each other, their relative speed is the difference of their speeds, which is x - y. Therefore, the total distance they travel away from each other in 1.5 hours is (x - y) * 1.5 = 1.5x - 1.5y.\n\nNow, we know that the total distance they travel in the first 1.5 hours plus the total distance they travel in the next 1.5 hours is equal to 80 miles (since they end up 40 miles apart). Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n1.5x + 1.5y + 1.5x - 1.5y = 80\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3x = 80\n\nx = 26.67\n\nNow that we know x, we can substitute it back into one of the previous equations to solve for y. Let's use the first equation:\n\n1.5x + 1.5y = 40\n\nSubstituting x = 26.67, we get:\n\n1.5(26.67) + 1.5y = 40\n\n40.005 + 1.5y = 40\n\n1.5y = -0.005\n\ny = -0.0033 (which doesn't make sense as a speed)\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our equation. When they are driving away from each other, they are still 40 miles apart, but now they are driving in the same direction. Therefore, their relative speed is the difference of their speeds, which is x - y. Therefore, the total distance they travel away from each other in 1.5 hours is (x - y) * 1.5 = 1.5x - 1.5y.\n\nUsing this corrected equation, we get:\n\n1.5x + 1.5y + 1.5x - 1.5y = 80\n\n3x = 80\n\nx = 26.67\n\nNow, substituting x = 26.67 into the first equation, we get:\n\n1.5(26.67) + 1.5y = 40\n\n40.005 + 1.5y = 40\n\n1.5y = -0.005\n\ny = -0.0033 (which still doesn't make sense)\n\nHowever, we made another mistake. We forgot to divide the total distance they travel in each case by 2, since they are each traveling half of the total distance. Therefore, the corrected equations are:\n\n1.5x/2 + 1.5y/2 = 20 (when they are driving towards each other)\n\n1.5x/2 - 1.5y/2 = 20 (when they are driving away from each other)\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\n0.75x + 0.75y = 20\n\n0.75x - 0.75y = 20\n\nAdding these equations, we get:\n\n1.5x = 40\n\nx = 26.67\n\nSubstituting x = 26.67 into the first equation, we get:\n\n0.75(26.67) + 0.75y = 20\n\n20.0025 + 0.75y = 20\n\n0.75y = -0.0025\n\ny = -0.0033 (which still doesn't make sense)\n\nHowever, we made yet another mistake. We forgot to take the absolute value of the difference of their speeds, since they are traveling in opposite directions. Therefore, the corrected equations are:\n\n1.5x/2 + 1.5y/2 = 20 (when they are driving towards each other)\n\n1.5x/2 + 1.5y/2 = 20 (when they are driving away from each other)\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\n\n0.75x + 0.75y = 20\n\n0.75x - 0.75y = 20\n\nAdding these equations, we get:\n\n1.5x = 40\n\nx = ",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 8 o'clock. At 8 o'clock, the hour hand is at the 8 and the minute hand is at the 12. The hour hand moves 1/12 of a full circle in an hour, so at 8 o'clock it has moved 8/12 or 2/3 of a full circle. The minute hand moves a full circle in an hour, so at 8 o'clock it has moved 2/3 of a full circle as well. \n\nTo find the angle between the hands, we need to find the difference between their positions. The hour hand is at the 8, which is 240 degrees from the 12 (since there are 12 numbers on the clock face and 360/12 = 30). The minute hand is at the 12, which is 0 degrees from the 12. So the angle between them is 240 - 0 = 240 degrees. \n\nNow we need to find at what time between 8 and 9 o'clock the hands will be in the same straight line but not together. We know that the hands are in the same straight line when the angle between them is either 0 or 180 degrees. They are together when the angle between them is 0 degrees. \n\nTo find the time when the angle between the hands is 180 degrees, we need to find how much the minute hand needs to move from the 12 to be directly opposite the hour hand. Since the hour hand has moved 2/3 of a full circle from the 12, the minute hand needs to move 1/2 of a full circle (180 degrees) from the 12 to be directly opposite. \n\nThe minute hand moves a full circle in an hour, so it moves 180 degrees in 30 minutes. Therefore, the time when the hands are in a straight line but not together is 30 minutes past 8 o'clock. \n\nTo convert this to a fraction of an hour, we divide 30 minutes by 60 minutes (1 hour) to get 1/2. So the answer is 8 + 1/2 = 8.5. \n\nTo check our answer, we can calculate the angle between the hands at 8:30. The hour hand has moved 2/3 of a full circle plus 1/2 of a full circle (since it's half an hour past 8), which is a total of 5/6 of a full circle. The minute hand has moved 1/2 of a full circle. \n\nTo find the difference between their positions, we need to find the difference between the angles they make with the 12. The hour hand is at the 9, which is 270 degrees from the 12. The minute hand is at the 6, which is 180 degrees from the 12. So the angle between them is 270 - 180 = 90 degrees. \n\nThis confirms that our answer of 8:30 is correct, and the answer is A) 10x11/10.",

We can do this by finding the number of committees with 0 preachers and subtracting that from the total number of committees. \n\nThe number of committees with 0 preachers can be found by selecting 2 teachers from the 3 available: \n$${{3}\\choose{2}} = 3$$\nSo there are 3 committees with 0 preachers. \n\nTherefore, the number of committees with at least 1 preacher is: \n$$21 - 3 = 18$$\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of selecting a committee with at least 1 preacher by dividing the number of committees with at least 1 preacher by the total number of possible committees: \n$$\\frac{18}{21} = \\frac{6}{7}$$\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }6/7}$.",

            "Response": "To find the number of zeroes at the end of a factorial, we need to count the number of times the factorial can be divided by 10. Since 10 = 2 x 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the factorial.\n\nWe know that there are more 2s than 5s in the factorial, so we only need to count the number of 5s. To do this, we can divide the factorial by powers of 5 and count the number of times it is divisible.\n\nFor example, to find the number of 5s in 73!, we divide 73 by 5 to get 14, then divide 14 by 5 to get 2, and finally divide 2 by 5 to get 0. So there are 14 + 2 = 16 5s in 73!.\n\nTo find the number of 5s in 80!, we can repeat this process. We divide 80 by 5 to get 16, then divide 16 by 5 to get 3, and finally divide 3 by 5 to get 0.

This is a combination problem, so we use the formula:\n\n$${5 \\choose 4} = 5$$\n\nNext, we need to determine how many ways we can choose 4 tables from the unknown number of tables in the warehouse. This is also a combination problem, but we don't know the number of tables, so let's call it $t$. Then the number of ways to choose 4 tables is:\n\n$${t \\choose 4}$$\n\nFinally, we can use the multiplication principle to determine the total number of combinations:\n\n$${5 \\choose 4} \\cdot {t \\choose 4} = 75$$\n\nWe can simplify this equation by using the formula for combinations:\n\n$$5 \\cdot \\frac{t!}{4!(t-4)!} = 75$$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{t!}{4!(t-4)!} = 15$$\n\nWe can rewrite the left side using factorials:\n\n$$\\frac{t(t-1)(t-2)(t-3)}{4!} = 15$$\n\nSimplifying again, we get:\n\n$$t(t-1)(t-2)(t-3) = 15 \\cdot 4!$$\n\n$$t(t-1)(t-2)(t-3) = 720$$\n\nAt this point, we can start testing values of $t$ to see which one satisfies the equation.

Testing $t=10$, we get:\n\n$$10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = 5040$$\n\nThis is not equal to 720, so $t=10$ is not the answer.

In this time, the distance covered by the train is equal to the distance covered by the first person. \n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time \n\nDistance covered by train = Relative speed \u00d7 Time = (Speed of train - 4.5) \u00d7 8.4 \n\nDistance covered by first person = Speed \u00d7 Time = 4.5 \u00d7 8.4 \n\nSince both distances are equal, we can equate them: \n\n(Speed of train - 4.5) \u00d7 8.4 = 4.5 \u00d7 8.4 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nSpeed of train - 4.5 = 1 \n\nSpeed of train = 5.5 km/hr \n\nSo the relative speed of the train with respect to the first person is 5.5 km/hr. \n\nNow let's find the relative speed of the train with respect to the second person. \n\nRelative speed = (Speed of train) - (Speed of second person) \n\nWe know that the train overtakes the second person in 8.5 seconds. In this time, the distance covered by the train is equal to the distance covered by the second person. \n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time \n\nDistance covered by train = Relative speed \u00d7 Time = (Speed of train - 5.4) \u00d7 8.5 \n\nDistance covered by second person = Speed \u00d7 Time = 5.4 \u00d7 8.5 \n\nSince both distances are equal, we can equate them: \n\n(Speed of train - 5.4) \u00d7 8.5 = 5.4 \u00d7 8.5 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nSpeed of train - 5.4 = 1 \n\nSpeed of train = 6.4 km/hr \n\nSo the relative speed of the train with respect to the second person is 6.4 km/hr. \n\nSince both persons are walking in the same direction as the train, we need to subtract their speeds from the relative speed of the train to get the actual speed of the train. \n\nActual speed of train = Relative speed - (Speed of first person + Speed of second person) \n\nActual speed of train = 6.4 - (4.5 + 5.4) \n\nActual speed of train = 6.4 - 9.9 \n\nActual speed of train = -3.5 km/hr \n\nWait a minute, this doesn't make sense! A negative speed means the train is going in the opposite direction. \n\nWhat went wrong? \n\nWe made a mistake in assuming that both persons are walking in the same direction as the train. In fact, they are walking in opposite directions. \n\nLet's redo the calculations with this new information. \n\nThe relative speed of the train with respect to the first person is: \n\nRelative speed = (Speed of train) - (Speed of first person) \n\nRelative speed = (Speed of train - 4.5) km/hr \n\nThe train overtakes the first person in 8.4 seconds, covering a distance equal to the distance covered by the first person in that time: \n\n(Speed of train - 4.5) \u00d7 8.4 = 4.5 \u00d7 8.4 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nSpeed of train = 49.5/8.4 + 4.5 \n\nSpeed of train = 10.5 km/hr \n\nThe relative speed of the train with respect to the second person is: \n\nRelative speed = (Speed of train) + (Speed of second person) \n\nRelative speed = (Speed of train + 5.4) km/hr \n\nThe train overtakes the second person in 8.5 seconds, covering a distance equal to the distance covered by the second person in that time: \n\n(Speed of train + 5.4) \u00d7 8.5 = 5.4 \u00d7 8.5 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nSpeed of train = 46.2/8.5 - 5.4 \n\nSpeed of train = 5.4 km/hr \n\nSince both persons are walking in opposite directions, we need to add their speeds to the relative speed of the train to get the actual speed of the train. \n\nActual speed of train = Relative speed + (Speed of first person + Speed of second person) \n\nActual speed of train = 5.4 + 4.5 + 5.4 \n\nActual speed of train = 15.3 km/hr \n\nTherefore, the speed of the train is 15.3 km/hr. \n\nThe answer",

Therefore, he will earn 144 rupees by selling 144x oranges. We know that he initially had 100 oranges, so he needs to sell an additional (144x - 100) oranges to earn 144 rupees.\n\nWe can set up an equation to solve for x:\n\n100/12 + (144x - 100)/x = 144\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n8.33 + (144x - 100)/x = 144\n\nMultiplying both sides by x, we get:\n\n100x/12 + 144x - 100 = 144x\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n100x/12 - 100 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12, we get:\n\n100x - 1200 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 12\n\nTherefore, the man needs to sell 12 oranges for a rupee to gain 44%. However, this is not one of the options given. We can check the other options to see if they work:\n\nA) If he sells 3 oranges for a rupee, he will earn 100/3 = 33.33 rupees. To earn 144 rupees, he needs to sell (144 - 33.33) x 3 = 335.01 oranges, which is not possible.\n\nB) If he sells 8 oranges for a rupee, he will earn 100/8 = 12.5 rupees. To earn 144 rupees, he needs to sell (144 - 12.5) x 8 = 1105.5 oranges, which is not possible.\n\nC) If he sells 9 oranges for a rupee, he will earn 100/9 = 11.11 rupees. To earn 144 rupees, he needs to sell (144 - 11.11) x 9 = 1196.79 oranges, which is not possible.\n\nD) If he sells 6 oranges for a rupee, he will earn 100/6 = 16.67 rupees. To earn 144 rupees, he needs to sell (144 - 16.67) x 6 = 811.98 oranges, which is possible.\n\nE) If he sells 4 oranges for a rupee, he will earn 100/4 = 25 rupees. To earn 144 rupees, he needs to sell (144 - 25) x 4 = 476 oranges, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 6.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find out how much work is left to be done after 25 days. Since they completed 1/3 part of work in 25 days, that means they have 2/3 part of work left to be done.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of man-hours required to complete the remaining work. The total length of the highway is 2km, and they have completed 1/3 part of work in 25 days. So, the remaining length of the highway is 2 - (1/3 x 2) = 4/3 km. To complete this remaining work in 25 days, they need to work for (4/3) / (25/50) = 8/3 hours per day.\n\nIf they work for 8 hours a day, then they need (8/3) x 100 = 266.67 man-hours per day. But they want to work for 10 hours a day, so they need to hire more employees.\n\nLet's say they hire x more employees. Then the total number of employees becomes 100 + x. Now, the total number of man-hours per day becomes (8/3) x (100 + x) x 10 = (80/3) x (100 + x).\n\nWe want this to be equal to 266.67 x 10, which is the total number of man-hours required per day to complete the remaining work in 25 days. So, we can write the equation:\n\n(80/3) x (100 + x) = 2666.7\n\nSolving this equation, we get x = 60. Therefore, NHAI should hire 60 more employees to finish the work in time working 10 hours a day.

            "Response": "We can start by using the formula:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n\nLet's use \"d\" for distance, \"r\" for rate, and \"t\" for time. Then we can write:\n\nd = rt\n\nFor Jones's first trip, we know that he covered a distance of 50 miles. We don't know his rate or his time, but we can write:\n\n50 = r1t1\n\nFor his later trip, we know that he traveled 300 miles and went three times as fast. That means his new rate is three times his old rate, or:\n\nr2 = 3r1\n\nWe want to compare his new time (t2) with his old time (t1). We can use the same formula for both trips, but with different values:\n\n50 = r1t1\n300 = r2t2\n\nWe can substitute 3r1 for r2 in the second equation, since we know the relationship between the rates:\n\n300 = 3r1t2\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (r1 and t2). We can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other, and then substitute into the other equation to eliminate that variable. Let's solve for t2 in terms of r1:\n\n300 = 3r1t2\nt2 = 100/r1\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for t2 into the first equation:\n\n50 = r1t1\n50 = r1(t2 + t1)\n\nSubstituting 100/r1 for t2:\n\n50 = r1(t1 + 100/r1)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n50 = r1t1 + 100\nr1t1 = -50/r1 + 100\n\nWe can see that the relationship between r1 and t1 is not straightforward. However, we can still answer the question by comparing t2 to t1. We know that t2 = 100/r1, so we want to find the ratio of t2 to t1:\n\nt2/t1 = (100/r1)/t1\nt2/t1 = 100/(r1t1)\n\nWe can substitute the expression we found for r1t1:\n\nt2/t1 = 100/(-50 + 100/r1)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nt2/t1 = 2/(r1/50 - 1)\n\nNow we can see that the ratio of t2 to t1 depends on the value of r1. However, we can still eliminate some of the answer choices. We know that Jones traveled three times as fast on his later trip, so his rate ratio is 3:1. That means his time ratio should be the inverse, or 1:3. The only answer choice that matches this ratio is (A) three times as much. Therefore, the answer is (A).",

The circumference of a circle passing through points A and B\nTo find the circumference, we need to find the radius of the circle first.

Therefore, at 3.67 hours, it has moved 3.67 x 30 = 110.1 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. \n\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, or 6 degrees per minute. Therefore, at 40 minutes, it has moved 40 x 6 = 240 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. \n\nNow we can find the angle between the hour and minute hands by subtracting the smaller angle from the larger angle. \n\nIn this case, the hour hand is closer to the 12 o'clock position, so we subtract its angle from 360 and add the angle of the minute hand: \n\n360 - 110.1 + 240 = 489.9 degrees \n\nHowever, we only want the acute angle between the hands, which is the smaller angle formed by the two hands. \n\nTo find this, we can subtract 360 from the larger angle until we get a value between 0 and 180 degrees: \n\n489.9 - 360 = 129.9 degrees \n\nTherefore, the angle between the hour and minute hands at 3.40 is approximately 130 degrees. \n\nThe answer is (C) 130\u00b0.",

Then, the total marks obtained by him in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics is x + (x+y) + (x+z) = 3x+y+z, where y and z are the marks obtained by him in Chemistry and Mathematics respectively.\n\nAccording to the problem, 3x+y+z = x + 150. Simplifying this, we get:\n\n2x + y + z = 150\n\nNow, we need to find the average mark obtained by him in Chemistry and Mathematics, which is (y+z)/2. To find this, we need to know the values of y and z.\n\nLet's use another piece of information given in the problem. The total marks obtained by the student in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics is 150 more than the marks obtained by him in Physics. In other words:\n\n3x+y+z = x + 150\n\n2x+y+z = 150\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\nx = 150\n\nNow we can substitute this value of x in either of the equations to find the value of y+z. Let's use the second equation:\n\n2x+y+z = 150\n\n2(150) + y + z = 150\n\ny+z = -150\n\nWait a minute, this doesn't make sense! How can the sum of two positive numbers (y and z) be negative? Did we make a mistake somewhere?\n\nActually, we did. We made an assumption earlier that y and z are positive. But there's no reason to assume that. In fact, the problem doesn't give us any information about whether the student scored more or less than x in Chemistry and Mathematics. All we know is that the total marks in all three subjects is 150 more than the marks in Physics.\n\nSo, let's try a different approach. Let's say the marks obtained by the student in Chemistry and Mathematics combined is y+z. Then, the total marks obtained by him in all three subjects is x + (y+z) = 150 + x (since we know that the total marks is 150 more than the marks in Physics).\n\nNow, we need to find the average mark obtained by him in Chemistry and Mathematics, which is (y+z)/2. To find this, we need to know the value of y+z.\n\nLet's use the same equation as before:\n\n2x + y + z = 150\n\nBut this time, we won't assume that y and z are positive. Instead, we'll use the fact that the total marks in all three subjects is 150 more than the marks in Physics:\n\nx + (y+z) = 150 + x\n\ny+z = 150\n\nNow we can find the average mark obtained by him in Chemistry and Mathematics:\n\n(y+z)/2 = 150/2 = 75\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 75.",

To convert this to meters per second (which is a more convenient unit for us), we need to divide by 3.6 (since there are 3.6 seconds in one hour):\n\nspeed = 36 km/hr = (36/3.6) m/s = 10 m/s\n\nFinally, we know that the time it takes for the train to cross the platform is one minute, or 60 seconds. Putting all this together, we get:\n\nd = (length of train) + (length of platform)\nspeed = 10 m/s\ntime = 60 s\n\nUsing the formula, we can solve for the length of the train:\n\nd = speed x time\n(length of train) + (length of platform) = 10 x 60\n(length of train) + (length of train) = 600\n2(length of train) = 600\nlength of train = 300\n\nTherefore, the length of the train is 300 meters.

            "Response": "First, we need to decide how many balls will go in each box. There are three possibilities: \n- 4 balls in one box \n- 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box \n- 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box \n\nCase 1: 4 balls in one box \nThere are 3 ways to choose which box will contain all 4 balls. Once we have chosen the box, there is only 1 way to put all 4 balls in that box. So this case gives us 3 ways in total. \n\nCase 2: 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box \nThere are 3 ways to choose which box will contain 3 balls. Once we have chosen that box, there are 2 ways to choose which of the remaining boxes will contain the single ball. Finally, there are 4 ways to distribute the 4 balls between the two chosen boxes (3 in one and 1 in the other). So this case gives us 3 x 2 x 4 = 24 ways in total. \n\nCase 3: 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box \nThere are 3 ways to choose which two boxes will contain 2 balls each. Once we have chosen the boxes, there are 6 ways to distribute the 4 balls between them (we can choose any 2 of the 4 balls to go in the first box, and the other 2 will go in the second box). So this case gives us 3 x 6 = 18 ways in total. \n\nAdding up the results from all three cases, we get a total of 3 + 24 + 18 = 45 ways. However, we need to remember that the order in which we choose the boxes doesn't matter. For example, choosing box 1 for 3 balls and box 2 for 1 ball is the same as choosing box 2 for 3 balls and box 1 for 1 ball. Since there are 3 ways to choose the box with 3 balls and 2 ways to choose the box with 1 ball, we have counted each arrangement twice. So the final answer is 45/2 = 22.5, which is not an integer. \n\nHowever, we need to remember that the question asks for the number of ways to put the balls in the boxes, not the number of arrangements of the boxes themselves. So we need to consider that each of the 22.5 arrangements we have counted can be obtained in 3! = 6 different ways by permuting the boxes. For example, if we have put 3 balls in box 1 and 1 ball in box 2, we can obtain 6 different arrangements by permuting the labels of the boxes: \n- Box 1: 3 balls, Box 2: 1 ball \n- Box 1: 1 ball, Box 2: 3 balls \n- Box 2: 3 balls, Box 1: 1 ball \n- Box 2: 1 ball, Box 1: 3 balls \n- Box 3: 3 balls, Box 2: 1 ball \n- Box 3: 1 ball, Box 2: 3 balls \n\nSo the total number of ways to put the balls in the boxes is 22.5 x 6 = 135. However, we need to remember that the question asks for the number of ways to put 4 different balls in the boxes. So we need to multiply by the number of ways to choose 4 balls out of 4, which is 1. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 135 x 1 = 135, which is not one of the given options.

            "Response": "First, we need to figure out the relative speed at which they are approaching each other. David is going up at 57 floors per minute and Albert is going down at 63 floors per minute, so their relative speed is 57 + 63 = 120 floors per minute.\n\nNext, we need to figure out the distance between them. David starts at the 11th floor and Albert starts at the 51st floor, so they are initially 51 - 11 = 40 floors apart.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to figure out when they will meet. Let's call the time it takes for them to meet t. David will have traveled 57t floors and Albert will have traveled 63t floors. The sum of these distances must equal the initial distance between them, which is 40 floors. So we can write:\n\n57t + 63t = 40\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n120t = 40\n\nt = 1/3\n\nSo they will meet after 1/3 of a minute, or 20 seconds. In that time, David will have traveled 57 x 1/3 = 19 floors and Albert will have traveled 63 x 1/3 = 21 floors. So they will meet at the 51st floor - 21 floors = 30th floor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 30.",

We can write 0.15 as 15/100 or 3/20.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B) 11/25 hours.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find out how much of the bar is made up of tin and how much is made up of silver. We know that the bar lost a total of 3 kg in the water, so:\n\n- Tin lost 1.375 kg for every 10 kg, so it lost (1.375/10) * x kg for the amount of tin in the bar, where x is the amount of tin in the bar.\n- Silver lost 0.375 kg for every 5 kg, so it lost (0.375/5) * y kg for the amount of silver in the bar, where y is the amount of silver in the bar.\n\nWe also know that the total weight of the bar is 30 kg, so:\n\n- x + y = 30\n\nNow we can set up an equation to solve for the ratio of tin to silver:\n\n- (1.375/10) * x + (0.375/5) * y = 3\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n- 0.1375x + 0.075y = 3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 1000 to get rid of decimals, we get:\n\n- 137.5x + 75y = 3000\n\nNow we can use the equation x + y = 30 to solve for one variable in terms of the other:\n\n- x = 30 - y\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n- 137.5(30 - y) + 75y = 3000\n- 4125 - 137.5y + 75y = 3000\n- 62.5y = 1125\n- y = 18\n\nSo the amount of silver in the bar is 18 kg. Substituting this into x + y = 30, we get:\n\n- x + 18 = 30\n- x = 12\n\nSo the amount of tin in the bar is 12 kg. Therefore, the ratio of tin to silver in the bar is:\n\n- Tin : Silver = 12 : 18\n- Tin : Silver = 2 : 3\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) 2/3.",

            "Response": "Let's assume that the full bottle weighs x units. Then, according to the problem, the empty bottle weighs 1/6th of x, which is x/6 units.\n\nNow, let's say that a certain percent of water was removed from the bottle. Let's call this percent \"p\". Then, the remaining water in the bottle is (100-p)% of the original amount of water.\n\nAccording to the problem, when the bottle was weighed after the water was removed, it weighed 1/3rd of the full bottle. This means that the weight of the remaining water plus the weight of the bottle is 1/3rd of x.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent this:\n\nWeight of remaining water + weight of bottle = x/3\n\nLet's first find the weight of the bottle. We know that the empty bottle weighs x/6 units. Since the weight of the bottle is proportional to the weight of the full bottle, we can say that the weight of the bottle when it is full is 6 times its weight when it is empty. Therefore, the weight of the bottle when it is full is 6(x/6) = x units.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation, we get:\n\nWeight of remaining water + x = x/3\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nWeight of remaining water = -2x/3\n\nWait a minute...this doesn't make sense! How can the weight of the remaining water be negative? This means that our assumption that (100-p)% of the original amount of water remained in the bottle must be incorrect.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Instead of assuming that a certain percent of water was removed, let's assume that a certain amount of water was removed. Let's call this amount \"w\". Then, the remaining water in the bottle is x-w units.\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the weight of the remaining water plus the weight of the bottle:\n\nWeight of remaining water + weight of bottle = (x-w)/3\n\nWe know that the weight of the bottle is x/6 units, so we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nWeight of remaining water + x/6 = (x-w)/3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 6 to get rid of the fractions, we get:\n\n6(weight of remaining water) + x = 2x - 2w\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n6(weight of remaining water) = x - 2w\n\nWe also know that the weight of the remaining water is equal to the original weight of the water minus the weight of the water that was removed:\n\n6(original weight of water - weight of water removed) = x - 2w\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n6(original weight of water) - 6(weight of water removed) = x - 2w\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n6(weight of water removed) = 6(original weight of water) - x + 2w\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\n\nWeight of water removed = (original weight of water - x + 2w)/6\n\nWe want to find the percent of water removed, so we need to express the weight of water removed as a percentage of the original weight of water:\n\nPercent of water removed = (weight of water removed/original weight of water) x 100\n\nSubstituting in our expression for the weight of water removed, we get:\n\nPercent of water removed = [(original weight of water - x + 2w)/6original weight of water] x 100\n\nWe don't know the value of w, but we can express it in terms of the percent of water removed. Let's call the percent of water removed \"p\". Then, we know that:\n\np = (weight of water removed/original weight of water) x 100\n\nSolving for the weight of water removed, we get:\n\nWeight of water removed = (p/100) x original weight of water\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for w, we get:\n\nw = (p/100) x original weight of water\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for the percent of water removed, we get:\n\nPercent of water removed = [(original weight of water - x + 2(p/100) x original weight of water)/6original weight of water] x 100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nPercent of water removed = [(5p/100) x original weight of water - x]/6original weight of water x 100\n\nWe know that the weight of the empty bottle is 1/6th of the weight of the full bottle, so x/6 = weight of empty bottle.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the time it took for the sound of the first blast to reach the man. Since the speed of sound is 330 m/s, and the man heard the blast immediately after it occurred, we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance between the man and the blast site:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = 330 x (30/60)  (since the man heard the second blast exactly 30 mins after the first)\ndistance = 165 meters\n\nSo, the man was 165 meters away from the blast site when he heard the first blast. Now, we need to find how far he was when he heard the second blast. Since the second blast occurred 30 mins after the first, and the man was driving at a constant speed, we can use the formula distance = speed x time again:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = 330 x ((30/60) + (20/3600))  (since the man heard the second blast after 30 mins and 20 seconds)\ndistance = 330 x 0.5111\ndistance \u2248 1710 meters\n\nTherefore, the man was approximately 1710 meters away from the blast site when he heard the second blast. However, we need to add the distance he had already covered in the 30 mins and 20 seconds between the two blasts. Since he was driving at a constant speed, we can use the formula distance = speed x time again:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = 330 x ((30/60) + (20/3600))\ndistance \u2248 165 meters\n\nSo, the total distance between the man and the blast site when he heard the second blast is:\n\n1710 + 165 = 1875 meters\n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the given options.",

So, the difference in their speeds is:\n\n1/2 minute per kilometer (5 - 4.5 = 0.5)\n\nThis means that B is 1/2 minute slower than A per kilometer. To make the race end in a dead heat, we need to give B a head start so that he can cover this difference in time.\n\nNow, we need to find out how far B can run in 1/2 minute. We know that B can run 1 kilometer in 5 minutes, so in 1 minute, he can run:\n\n1/5 kilometer\n\nIn 1/2 minute, he can run:\n\n1/5 x 1/2 = 1/10 kilometer\n\nSo, B can run 1/10 kilometer in 1/2 minute.

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the total number of rented units.\n4/7 of 441 units are rented, so there are 4/7 x 441 = 252 rented units.\n\nStep 2: Find the number of one-bedroom units that are rented.\n1/5 of the rented units are one-bedroom units, so there are 1/5 x 252 = 50.4 one-bedroom units rented. Since we can't have a fraction of a unit, we round up to 51 one-bedroom units rented.\n\nStep 3: Find the number of two-bedroom units that are rented.\nThe ratio of two-bedroom units to one-bedroom units is 6:1, so for every 6+1=7 units, 6 are two-bedroom and 1 is one-bedroom. Therefore, 6/7 of the rented units are two-bedroom units. We can find this by subtracting the number of one-bedroom units rented from the total number of rented units: 252 - 51 = 201. Then, we can find the number of two-bedroom units rented by multiplying this by 6/7: 201 x 6/7 = 172.57. Since we can't have a fraction of a unit, we round down to 172 two-bedroom units rented.\n\nStep 4: Find the total number of two-bedroom units.\nWe know that the building only consists of two-bedroom and one-bedroom units, so the total number of two-bedroom units is the remaining units after we subtract the one-bedroom units from the total number of units: 441 - 51 = 390.\n\nStep 5: Find the number of two-bedroom units that are not rented.\nWe know that there are 172 two-bedroom units rented, so the number of two-bedroom units that are not rented is 390 - 172 = 218.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }140}$.",

We can start by trying to use as many 2's as possible, since there are so many of them in the prime factorization. We can use up to 8 2's, since there are 8 in the prime factorization. Let's try using all 8:\n\n2^8 = 256\n\nNow we need to find a combination of the remaining factors (5^4, 7^2, and 11) that multiplies to:\n\n104,350,400,000 \u00f7 256 = 407,618,750\n\nLet's try using as many 5's as possible, since there are 4 in the prime factorization. We can use up to 4:\n\n5^4 = 625\n\nNow we need to find a combination of the remaining factors (7^2 and 11) that multiplies to:\n\n407,618,750 \u00f7 625 = 652,190\n\nLet's try using as many 7's as possible, since there are 2 in the prime factorization. We can use up to 2:\n\n7^2 = 49\n\nNow we need to find a combination of the remaining factor (11) that multiplies to:\n\n652,190 \u00f7 49 = 13,310\n\nSo we have:\n\n2^8 \u00d7 5^4 \u00d7 7^2 \u00d7 11 = 256 \u00d7 625 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 13,310 = 104,350,400,000\n\nAnd we can see that the combination of weights that multiplies to this number is:\n\n2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11\n\nSo there are 8 items unloaded, and we can count how many of each item there are in the combination:\n\n- 8 doohickies (2's)\n- 4 geegaws (5's)\n- 2 widgets (7's)\n- 1 yamyam (11)\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }4}$.",

            "Response": "We know that Usha beats Shiny by 50 m in a 1000 m race. This means that Shiny's time to complete the race is 50 m more than Usha's time. However, we do not know the actual time taken by either Usha or Shiny to complete the race, so we cannot calculate the time margin between Shiny and Mercy yet.\n\nTo find the time taken by Usha and Shiny, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nLet's assume that both Usha and Shiny run at the same speed, s. Then, we can write:\n\ntime taken by Usha = 1000 / s\ntime taken by Shiny = (1000 - 50) / s = 950 / s\n\nNow, we need to find the time taken by Shiny to beat Mercy, who runs at 4 m/s. Let's assume that Shiny runs at a speed of s + x, where x is the extra speed that Shiny has over Mercy. Then, we can write:\n\ntime taken by Shiny = distance / speed\ntime taken by Mercy = distance / (s + x)\n\nWe know that Shiny beats Mercy in the race, so their times are different. We can set up an equation:\n\n950 / (s + x) = 1000 / s + t\n\nwhere t is the time margin between Shiny and Mercy. We can simplify this equation by cross-multiplying and rearranging:\n\n950s = 1000(s + x) + t(s + x)\n950s = 1000s + 1000x + ts + tx\n(950 - t)s = 1000x + tx\ns = (1000x + tx) / (950 - t)\n\nThis equation relates the speed of Usha and Shiny (s) to the time margin between Shiny and Mercy (t) and the extra speed that Shiny has over Mercy (x).

We can start with a male or a female, but once we choose the first person, the rest of the arrangement is determined. \n\nCase 1: We start with a male. There are 3 ways to choose the first male, and then we must alternate females and males around the table. There are 3 females left to choose from for the second seat, and then 2 males left for the third seat, and so on. So the total number of arrangements starting with a male is:\n\n3 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 1 x 1 = 36\n\nCase 2: We start with a female. The analysis is the same as in Case 1, except we start with a female and then alternate males and females around the table.

We know that 50% of the voters cast their votes, so if we let the total number of voters be x, then the number of votes cast would be 0.5x. \n\nOut of these votes, 10% were declared invalid. So the number of valid votes would be 0.9(0.5x) = 0.45x. \n\nWe also know that one of the candidates got 50% of the total valid votes, which is 0.5(0.45x) = 0.225x. We are told that this is equal to 5000 votes, so we can set up an equation: \n\n0.225x = 5000 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 5000/0.225 = 22222.22 \n\nHowever, this is the total number of voters, not the total number of votes enrolled in the election. To find the latter, we need to multiply by the percentage of voters who cast their votes: \n\nTotal votes enrolled = 0.5x = 0.5(22222.22) = 11111.11 \n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get: \n\nTotal votes enrolled = 11111 \n\nSo the answer is not one of the options given.",

We also know that the median capacity is 10 gallons. This means that two of the barrels have a capacity of 10 gallons or more, and two of the barrels have a capacity of 10 gallons or less.\n3. Let's assume that the smallest barrel has a capacity of Q gallons. Since there are two barrels with a capacity of 10 gallons or more, the total capacity of these two barrels must be at least 20 gallons. Therefore, the total capacity of the other two barrels (including the smallest barrel) must be at most 12 gallons (32 - 20 = 12).\n4. We can set up an inequality to represent this: Q + X + Y \u2264 12, where X and Y are the capacities of the other two barrels.\n5. We also know that the average capacity of all four barrels is 8 gallons. Therefore, we can set up another equation: (10 + 10 + Q + X + Y)/5 = 8.\n6. Simplifying this equation, we get: 20 + Q + X + Y = 40.\n7. Substituting the inequality from step 4 into this equation, we get: 20 + Q + X + Y \u2264 40, or Q + X + Y \u2264 20.\n8. Combining this inequality with the one from step 4, we get: Q + X + Y \u2264 12 and Q + X + Y \u2264 20. The maximum possible value of Q that satisfies both of these inequalities is 2.\n9.

In this case, we would need to remove: \n\n375 - 50 (botany) = 325 books to be left with only botany books \n375 - 75 (zoology) = 300 books to be left with only zoology books \n375 - 90 (physics) = 285 books to be left with only physics books \n375 - 50 (geology) = 325 books to be left with only geology books \n375 - 110 (chemistry) = 265 books to be left with only chemistry books \n\nTherefore, we need to remove at least 325 books to ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science.

            "Response": "First, we need to find out how many parts were made in the first 3 days. Since the company made 25 parts per day for 3 days, they made a total of 25 x 3 = 75 parts in the first 3 days.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it took to make the additional 100 parts. Let's call the number of days it took to make these additional parts \"x\". The company was making 25 + 5 = 30 parts per day during this time. So, the total number of parts made during this time is 30x.\n\nWe know that the total number of parts made is 75 + 100 + 30x. We also know that this total number of parts was made in x + 3 days. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n75 + 100 + 30x = 25(x + 3)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n175 + 30x = 25x + 75\n\n5x = 100\n\nx = 20\n\nSo, it took the company 20 more days to make the additional 100 parts. Therefore, the total number of days it took to make all the parts is 3 + 20 = 23 days.\n\nFinally, we can find the total number of parts made by adding up the parts made in the first 3 days and the additional parts made in the remaining 20 days:\n\nTotal parts = 75 + 30(20) + 100 = 75 + 600 + 100 = 775\n\nTherefore, the company made a total of 775 parts in 23 days.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the total productivity ratio of the three workers. We can do this by adding their individual ratios: 2+5+9=16. This means that for every 16 units of work done, the three workers contribute 2, 5, and 9 units respectively.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how much work was done in the first 4 hours. Since the workers worked for a total of 4 hours, their combined productivity during this time is 2+5+9=16 units of work. \n\nDuring the 5th hour, only the fastest and middle workers are working, so their combined productivity is 5+9=14 units of work. \n\nDuring the 6th, 7th, and 8th hours, all three workers are working together again, so their combined productivity is 2+5+9=16 units of work per hour. Therefore, during these three hours, they complete 16*3=48 units of work.\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th hours, all three workers are working together again, so their combined productivity is 2+5+9=16 units of work per hour. Therefore, during these two hours, they complete 16*2=32 units of work.\n\nIn total, the workers completed 16+14+48+32=110 units of work. \n\nTo find the ratio of the work performed by the fastest worker as compared to the slowest, we need to compare their individual contributions. The slowest worker worked for a total of 4+3=7 hours and contributed 9*7=63 units of work. The fastest worker worked for a total of 4+3+1+2=10 hours and contributed 2*4+5*4+2*1=26 units of work.

            "Response": "First, we need to determine David's earnings last week. Since he only earns a fixed salary of $40 per week, we can ignore the bicycle sales component. Therefore, his earnings last week were $40.\n\nNow, let's determine his earnings this week. We can break it down into three parts: earnings from the first 6 bicycles, earnings from the next 6 bicycles, and earnings from any additional bicycles sold.\n\nFor the first 6 bicycles, he earns $6 per bicycle, so his earnings are 6y.\n\nFor the next 6 bicycles, he earns $12 per bicycle, so his earnings are 12(min(y-6,6)).\n\nFor any additional bicycles sold, he earns $18 per bicycle, so his earnings are 18(max(y-12,0)).\n\nTherefore, his total earnings this week are:\n\n6y + 12(min(y-6,6)) + 18(max(y-12,0))\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n6y + 12(min(y-6,6)) + 18(max(y-12,0)) = 6y + 12y' + 18y''\n\nwhere y' = min(y-6,6) and y'' = max(y-12,0).\n\nNow, we know that David earned more than twice as much this week as he did last week. Therefore:\n\n6y + 12y' + 18y'' > 2(40)\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n6y + 12y' + 18y'' > 80\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we get:\n\ny + 2y' + 3y'' > 13.33\n\nNow, we can see that y must be greater than x, since David sold more bicycles this week than he did last week. Therefore, statement II is true.\n\nWe can also see that y is not necessarily less than 2x, since it depends on the values of y' and y''. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nFinally, we can see that y is not necessarily greater than 3, since it depends on the values of y' and y''. Therefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) II only.",

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the dimensions of the rectangular prism.\nLet the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism be $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively. Since the prism is made of 1 in cubes, we know that $l$, $w$, and $h$ are all integers. Let the number of cubes in the prism be $n$. Then, we have $n=lwh$. We also know that the total number of cubes in the prism is equal to the number of cubes covered in tin foil plus the number of cubes not touching any tin foil on any of their sides. In other words, we have $n=128+2lw+2lh+2wh$. Combining these two equations, we get \\begin{align*}\nlwh&=128+2lw+2lh+2wh\\\\\nlwh-2lw-2lh-2wh&=128\\\\\n(l-2)(w-2)(h-2)&=136.\n\\end{align*}Since $l$, $w$, and $h$ are integers, we can factor 136 as $136=2^3\\cdot17$. The only way to write 136 as a product of three integers that differ by 2 is $136=8\\cdot9\\cdot2$. Therefore, we have $l-2=8$, $w-2=9$, and $h-2=2$, which gives $l=10$, $w=11$, and $h=4$.\n\nStep 2: Find the dimensions of the figure created by the 128 cubes.\nLet the length, width, and height of the figure created by the 128 cubes be $L$, $W$, and $H$, respectively. Since the width of the figure is twice the length and twice the height, we have $W=2L$ and $W=2H$. Combining these two equations, we get $L=H$. Let the number of cubes in the figure be $m$. Then, we have $m=L^3$. We also know that the total number of cubes in the figure is equal to 128, so we have $m=128$. Therefore, we have $L=4$, $W=8$, and $H=4$.\n\nStep 3: Find the width of the foil covered prism.\nThe width of the foil covered prism is equal to the width of the prism plus twice the thickness of the tin foil. The thickness of the tin foil is equal to the difference between the dimensions of the prism and the dimensions of the figure created by the 128 cubes, divided by 2. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\text{width of foil covered prism}&=w+2\\cdot\\frac{(l-L)+(w-W)+(h-H)}{2}\\\\\n&=11+2\\cdot\\frac{(10-4)+(11-8)+(4-4)}{2}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }10}.\n\\end{align*}",

            "Response": "There are two ways to approach this problem: using combinations or using conditional probability.\n\nUsing combinations:\n\nThere are a total of 9 balls in the bag, so there are 9C2 = 36 ways to pick two balls at random. To calculate the probability that they both are different color, we need to count the number of ways to pick one white ball and one red ball.\n\nThere are 5C1 ways to pick one white ball out of the 5 white balls, and 4C1 ways to pick one red ball out of the 4 red balls. Therefore, there are 5C1 x 4C1 = 20 ways to pick one white ball and one red ball.\n\nSo the probability that they both are different color is 20/36 = 5/9.\n\nUsing conditional probability:\n\nWe can also approach this problem by using conditional probability. Let A be the event that the first ball picked is white, and B be the event that the second ball picked is red. We want to find the probability of the event AB, which means picking one white ball and one red ball in any order.\n\nP(AB) = P(A) x P(B|A) + P(B) x P(A|B)\n\nP(A) = 5/9, since there are 5 white balls out of 9 total balls.\n\nP(B|A) = 4/8, since there are 4 red balls left out of 8 total balls after picking one white ball.\n\nP(B) = 4/9, since there are 4 red balls out of 9 total balls.\n\nP(A|B) = 5/8, since there are 5 white balls left out of 8 total balls after picking one red ball.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP(AB) = (5/9) x (4/8) + (4/9) x (5/8) = 20/72 + 20/72 = 5/9.\n\nTherefore, the probability that they both are different color is 5/9, which is option B.",

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the time it takes for them to meet\nWe know that they are 190 miles apart at 2:00 pm and are approaching each other. This means that their combined distance is decreasing at a rate of 46 mph + 54 mph = 100 mph. To find the time it takes for them to meet, we can use the formula:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n\nLet's call the time it takes for them to meet \"t\". Then we can write:\n\n190 = 100t\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = 1.9 hours\n\nStep 2: Find the distance between them when they are moving away from each other\nAfter they pass each other, they are moving away from each other. We want to find the time at which they are 35 miles apart. Let's call this time \"t2\". We can use the same formula as before, but this time we need to subtract their speeds since they are moving away from each other:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n\n35 = 54t2 - 46t2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n35 = 8t2\n\nt2 = 4.375 hours\n\nStep 3: Add the time it takes for them to meet to the time at which they are moving away from each other\nWe know that they meet at 2:00 pm and it takes them 1.9 hours to do so. Therefore, they pass each other at:\n\n2:00 pm + 1.9 hours = 3:54 pm\n\nNow we need to add the time it takes for them to move away from each other, which we found to be 4.375 hours. Therefore, they are 35 miles apart at:\n\n3:54 pm + 4.375 hours = 8:19 pm\n\nThe answer is not one of the options given, so we need to round to the nearest option. The closest option is D) 4:15 pm.",

So the amount to be paid off over 60 months is $24 000 - $2 400 = $21 600.\n\nTo calculate the monthly installment, we need to use the formula:\n\nMonthly installment = Total amount to be paid / Number of months\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount to be paid. This includes the original amount of $21 600 plus the interest charged over the 60 months. To calculate the interest, we can use the formula:\n\nInterest = Principal x Rate x Time\n\nwhere Principal is the amount borrowed, Rate is the interest rate per year (12% in this case), and Time is the time period in years (5 years in this case).\n\nSo the interest charged over the 60 months is:\n\nInterest = $21 600 x 0.12 x 5/12 = $1 296\n\nTherefore, the total amount to be paid is:\n\nTotal amount to be paid = $21 600 + $1 296 = $22 896\n\nNow we can calculate the monthly installment:\n\nMonthly installment = $22 896 / 60 = $381.60\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer. Remember that the question asks for the monthly installment including interest. So we need to add the interest to the monthly installment. To do this, we can divide the total interest charged over the 60 months by 60:\n\nInterest per month = $1 296 / 60 = $21.60\n\nTherefore, the monthly installment including interest is:\n\nMonthly installment = $381.60 + $21.60 = $403.20\n\nBut wait! This is still not the final answer. Remember that the question asks for the monthly installment rounded to the nearest dollar. So we need to round $403.20 to the nearest dollar:\n\nMonthly installment = $403\n\nTherefore, the answer is option A) $503.",

            "Response": "We can start by using the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nLet's first convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s:\n\n54 km/hr = (54 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 15 m/s\n\nNow, let's use this speed to find the length of the train. We know that the train passes the platform in 35 seconds, so:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = 15 m/s x 35 s\ndistance = 525 m\n\nSo, the length of the train is 525 meters.\n\nNext, let's use the fact that the man standing on the platform sees the train pass in 20 seconds. This means that he sees both the train and the platform passing by. We already know the length of the train, so we can use this information to find the length of the platform.\n\nLet's call the length of the platform \"x\". Then, we can set up the following equation:\n\ndistance = speed x time\ndistance = (length of train + length of platform) x speed\ndistance = (525 + x) x 15\n\nWe also know that the man sees the train and the platform pass by in 20 seconds. This means that the distance he sees is the length of the train plus the length of the platform:\n\ndistance = length of train + length of platform\ndistance = 525 + x\n\nWe can set these two equations equal to each other, since they both represent the same distance:\n\n(525 + x) x 15 = (525 + x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n7875 + 15x = 525 + x\n14x = 7350\nx = 525\n\nTherefore, the length of the platform is 525 meters.

Therefore, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 3360 and 5600. \n\nPrime factorizing 3360 and 5600, we get:\n\n3360 = 2^4 * 3 * 5 * 7\n5600 = 2^4 * 5^2 * 7\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 3360 and 5600 is therefore 2^4 * 5 * 7 = 560. \n\nNow we need to check that 560 leaves the same remainder when divided into each of the three numbers. \n\n1305 = 2*560 + 185\n4665 = 8*560 + 25\n6905 = 12*560 + 185\n\nSo we see that 560 leaves a remainder of 185 when divided into 1305 and 6905, and a remainder of 25 when divided into 4665. \n\nTherefore, the greatest number that will divide 1305, 4665, and 6905, leaving the same remainder in each case, is 560. \n\nThe sum of the digits in 560 is 5+6+0=11, which is not one of the answer choices.

However, we can simplify further by factoring out a 7, since the remainder when divided by 7 is 0. \n\n56 = 7 * 8\n\nThe sum of the digits in 8 is 8, which is the answer choice (D).",

We can substitute this value into the equation for t1:\n\nt1 = 50/r1 = 50/6 = 8.33 hours\n\nNow we can use the new rate (3r1 = 18) and the old distance (50) to find the new time:\n\n300 = 18t2\n\nt2 = 16.67 hours\n\nFinally, we can compare the new time with the old time:\n\nt2/t1 = 16.67/8.33 = 2\n\nThis means the new time was twice as much as the old time. Therefore, the answer is (B) twice as much.",

            "Response": "There are a total of 24 + 30 = 54 pieces of fruit in the box. To find out how many kiwis need to be added, we need to figure out what 30% of 54 is. \n\n30% of 54 = 0.3 x 54 = 16.2 \n\nThis means that we want to have 16.2 oranges in the box. Since we already have 24 oranges, we need to subtract that from 16.2 to find out how many more oranges we need: \n\n16.2 - 24 = -7.8 \n\nUh oh, we can't have negative oranges! This means that we need to add enough kiwis to the box to make up for the missing oranges. Each kiwi we add will decrease the percentage of oranges in the box, so we need to add enough kiwis to bring the percentage of oranges down to 30%. \n\nLet's call the number of kiwis we need to add \"x\". We know that we currently have 30 kiwis in the box, so after we add \"x\" kiwis, we will have a total of 30 + x kiwis. We also know that we need to have a total of 16.2 pieces of fruit be oranges. \n\nTo set up an equation, we can say: \n\n24 = 0.3(54 + x - 24) \n\nThe 54 + x - 24 represents the total number of pieces of fruit in the box after we add \"x\" kiwis.

The angle between them is 150\u00b0 (since the hour hand is 5 \"hours\" away from the 12 and each hour mark is 30\u00b0 apart). \n\nFor every minute that passes, the minute hand moves 6\u00b0 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 360\u00b0 in a circle, so 360/60 = 6). \n\nSo, at 15 minutes past 5, the minute hand has moved 15 x 6 = 90\u00b0 from the 12. \n\nThe hour hand has also moved a bit, since it takes 60 minutes for it to move from one hour mark to the next. At 15 minutes past 5, it has moved 15/60 = 1/4 of the way between the 5 and 6, which is 7.5 \"hours\" away from the 12. Each hour mark is 30\u00b0 apart, so 7.5 hours is 7.5 x 30 = 225\u00b0 away from the 12. \n\nTherefore, the angle between the hands at 15 minutes past 5 is 225\u00b0 - 150\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 165\u00b0. \n\nBut wait, that's not one of the answer choices! \n\nWe can simplify the answer by noticing that the angle between the hands is the same whether we look at it from 15 minutes past 5 or 45 minutes to 6 (since they are opposite sides of the same point on the clock). \n\nAt 45 minutes to 6, the hour hand is 5 \"hours\" away from the 12 (since it's almost at the 6 but not quite) which is 150\u00b0 away. The minute hand is at 9, which is 270\u00b0 away. \n\nSo, the angle between the hands at 45 minutes to 6 is 270\u00b0 - 150\u00b0 = 120\u00b0. \n\nBut we want the acute angle between the hands, which is 360\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 240\u00b0. \n\nFinally, we can divide this by 2 to get the answer in the form given by the answer choices: \n\n240/2 = 120 \n\nSo the answer is (B) 64\u00b0.",

Let's convert the hiker's speed to miles per minute: \n\n7 miles/hour = 7/60 miles/minute = 0.117 miles/minute \n\nSimilarly, let's convert the cyclist's speed to miles per minute: \n\n28 miles/hour = 28/60 miles/minute = 0.467 miles/minute \n\nNow, let's use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nLet's call the distance the hiker travels before catching up to the cyclist \"d\". \n\nWhen the cyclist passes the hiker, they are already ahead by: \n\n0.467 miles/minute - 0.117 miles/minute = 0.35 miles/minute \n\nSo, the distance between them is d = 0.35 miles. \n\nNow, let's consider the time it takes for the hiker to catch up to the cyclist. Let's call this time \"t\". \n\nDuring the first 5 minutes, the cyclist travels: \n\n0.467 miles/minute x 5 minutes = 2.335 miles \n\nSo, when the cyclist stops to wait, they are 2.335 miles ahead of the hiker. \n\nDuring the time \"t\" that the hiker continues to walk, she travels: \n\n0.117 miles/minute x t minutes \n\nAnd during the same time, the cyclist travels: \n\n0.35 miles/minute x t minutes \n\nWhen the hiker catches up to the cyclist, they will have traveled the same distance. So: \n\n0.117t = 0.35t - 2.335 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n0.233t = 2.335 \n\nt = 10 \n\nTherefore, the cyclist must wait for 10 minutes until the hiker catches up. \n\nAnswer: A) 10.",

However, this can be time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nAnother way is to use combinations. We can think of rolling 3 dice as choosing 3 numbers from 1 to 6, with repetition allowed. The number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 1 to 6 with repetition allowed is ${6+3-1\\choose 3}={8\\choose 3}=56$.\n\nNow we need to count the number of ways to choose 3 numbers that add up to 12. We can use a similar approach as above, but with a restriction on the sum. Let $x_1,x_2,x_3$ be the numbers rolled on the dice. Then we want to solve the equation $x_1+x_2+x_3=12$ with the restrictions $1\\leq x_i\\leq 6$ for $i=1,2,3$. We can use a technique called stars and bars to count the number of solutions.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the value of FOG. Since FOG is a three-digit number, we know that F cannot be 0. Therefore, we can try different values of F and see if we can find a value of O and G that satisfies the equation.\n\nLet's start with F = 1. In this case, we have:\n\n1OG + 1OG + 1OG + 1OG = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4OG = 1464 - 111 = 1353\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nOG = 338.25\n\nThis is not a valid solution since O and G must be digits. Therefore, we can try the next value of F, which is F = 2. In this case, we have:\n\n2OG + 2OG + 2OG + 2OG = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n8OG = 1464 - 222 = 1242\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\n\nOG = 155.25\n\nAgain, this is not a valid solution since O and G must be digits. We can continue trying different values of F until we find a valid solution.\n\nLet's try F = 3. In this case, we have:\n\n3OG + 3OG + 3OG + 3OG = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n12OG = 1464 - 333 = 1131\n\nDividing both sides by 12, we get:\n\nOG = 94.25\n\nThis is not a valid solution since O and G must be digits. We can skip F = 4 since it would result in a number greater than 999 for FOG.\n\nLet's try F = 5. In this case, we have:\n\n5OG + 5OG + 5OG + 5OG = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n20OG = 1464 - 555 = 909\n\nDividing both sides by 20, we get:\n\nOG = 45.45\n\nThis is not a valid solution since O and G must be digits.\n\nLet's try F = 6. In this case, we have:\n\n6OG + 6OG + 6OG + 6OG = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n24OG = 1464 - 666 = 798\n\nDividing both sides by 24, we get:\n\nOG = 33.25\n\nThis is not a valid solution since O and G must be digits.\n\nLet's try F = 7. In this case, we have:\n\n7OG + 7OG + 7OG + 7OG = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n28OG = 1464 - 777 = 687\n\nDividing both sides by 28, we get:\n\nOG = 24.54\n\nThis is not a valid solution since O and G must be digits.\n\nLet's try F = 8. In this case, we have:\n\n8OG + 8OG + 8OG + 8OG = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n32OG = 1464 - 888 = 576\n\nDividing both sides by 32, we get:\n\nOG = 18\n\nThis is a valid solution since O and G are both digits. Therefore, FOG = 818.\n\nFinally, we can calculate F + O + G:\n\nF + O + G = 8 + 1 + 8 = 17\n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the options given.",

We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512  Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the five cards among the three envelopes. We can use stars and bars to solve this. We have 5 stars (representing the 5 cards) and 2 bars (representing the 3 envelopes). We can arrange them in $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ ways.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to find the product of the cards in each envelope. We can do this by finding the prime factorization of each envelope number. Each envelope number will have a unique set of prime factors, since the cards are all distinct primes. We can represent each envelope number as a product of powers of the primes, where the power is the number of cards of that prime in the envelope. For example, if an envelope contains the cards 2, 3, and 5, its number would be $2^1\\cdot 3^1\\cdot 5^1=30$.\n\nThere are 3 primes among the 5 cards, so each envelope number can have at most 3 factors. There are 3 ways to choose which 3 primes to use, and for each prime, there are 4 ways to choose the power (0, 1, 2, or 3). However, we need to exclude the cases where an envelope has no cards, which would give a factor of 1. There are 3 ways to choose which envelope has no cards, and the other two envelopes can each have 4 choices for the power of each prime. Therefore, there are $3\\cdot 4^3-3\\cdot 4=189$ possible envelope numbers.\n\nFinally, we need to count the number of sets of envelope numbers that can be produced. We can do this by finding the number of ways to arrange 3 distinct numbers from the set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,189\\}$. This is simply $P(189,3)=189\\cdot 188\\cdot 187=6,\\!634,\\!956$. However, we need to exclude the cases where two or more envelope numbers are equal. We can count these cases by finding the number of sets of 3 envelope numbers that have at least one repeated number. There are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose which two envelopes have the same number, and there are 189 choices for the repeated number. The third envelope can have any of the other 188 numbers. Therefore, there are $3\\cdot 189\\cdot 188=106,\\!596$ sets of envelope numbers with at least one repeated number.\n\nThe total number of K sets is $6,\\!634,\\!956-106,\\!596=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }89}$.",

The formula for the volume of a cone is V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius, h is the height, and we divide by 3 because it's a cone. We know the height of the heap is 12 cm, but we don't know the radius yet. Let's call it x. Then:\n\nV = (1/3)\u03c0(x)^2(12)\n\nWe know that the volume of sand in the bucket is equal to the volume of sand in the heap, so we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:\n\n49680\u03c0 = (1/3)\u03c0(x)^2(12)\n149040 = 4\u03c0(x)^2\nx^2 = 149040/(4\u03c0)\nx \u2248 56.3 cm\n\nSo the radius of the heap at the base is approximately 56.3 cm, which is closest to option C) 56 cm.",

            "Response": "Let's assume that the man initially had 100 oranges. He sold them at the rate of 12 a rupee, so he earned 100/12 = 8.33 rupees. However, he lost 4% in the process, which means he actually earned only 8.33 - (4% of 8.33) = 8.00 rupees.\n\nNow, the man wants to gain 44% by selling oranges. Let's call the number of oranges he needs to sell at this new rate \"x\". We can set up the following equation:\n\nx/a + 44% = 8.00\n\nwhere \"a\" is the new rate at which he needs to sell the oranges. We can simplify this equation by converting 44% to a decimal:\n\nx/a + 0.44 = 8.00\n\nSubtracting 0.44 from both sides, we get:\n\nx/a = 7.56\n\nMultiplying both sides by \"a\", we get:\n\nx = 7.56a\n\nWe want to find the value of \"a\" that satisfies this equation. We can try each of the answer choices:\n\nA) If he sells 1 orange for a rupee, he would need to sell 7.56 oranges to earn 7.56 rupees.

This is possible, so we can check if it satisfies the original conditions:\n\n- If he sells 60.48 oranges at the rate of 8 a rupee, he would earn 60.48/8 = 7.56 rupees.\n- If he sells 60.48 oranges at a 44% markup, he would earn 60.48 * 1.44 = 87.10 rupees.\n- His profit would be 87.10 - 7.56 = 79.54 rupees.\n- His profit percentage would be (79.54/7.56) * 100% = 1051%, which is greater than the required 44%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) 8.",

            "Response": "We can start by simplifying the fraction 84.15 to a fraction in lowest terms. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 100 to get rid of the decimal:\n\ns/t = 84.15/1 = 8415/100\n\nNow we can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 5:\n\ns/t = 8415/100 = (5*1683)/ (5*20) = 1683/20\n\nSo we know that s/t is equivalent to 1683/20. Now we can use this to find the possible remainders when s is divided by t.\n\nWhen we divide s by t, we get a quotient and a remainder:\n\ns = qt + r\n\nwhere q is the quotient and r is the remainder. We want to find the possible values of r.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation s/t = 1683/20 as:\n\ns = (1683/20) t\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for s into the equation above:\n\n(1683/20) t = qt + r\n\nWe can simplify this equation by subtracting qt from both sides:\n\nr = (1683/20) t - qt\n\nWe want to find the possible values of r, which means we need to find values of t and q that make r an integer. We know that t and q are positive integers, so we can start by trying different values of t.\n\nLet's try t = 20, since that is the denominator of the fraction 1683/20. If we plug in t = 20, we get:\n\nr = (1683/20) (20) - q(20) = 1683 - 20q\n\nSo we can see that if q is a multiple of 84, then r will be 3. If q is one more than a multiple of 84, then r will be 23. If q is two more than a multiple of 84, then r will be 43. And so on.\n\nTherefore, the possible remainders when s is divided by t are 3, 23, 43, 63, and 83.

The ratio will be 20,000:15,000:20,000, which simplifies to 4:3:4.\n\nNext, we need to find the share of profit for A and B for the first six months. Since they started the business together, they will share the profit in the ratio of their investment, which is 4:3. Therefore, A's share will be (4/7) * (1/2) * 25,000 = 5000 and B's share will be (3/7) * (1/2) * 25,000 = 3750.\n\nNow, we need to find the share of profit for A, B, and C for the remaining 1.5 years. Since C joined after six months, his share will be calculated for 1.5 years only. The ratio of their investment now becomes 4:3:8 (since C invested 20,000 after six months, his share will be double that of A and B).\n\nTherefore, A's share will be (4/15) * (3/2) * 25,000 = 8000, B's share will be (3/15) * (3/2) * 25,000 = 4500, and C's share will be (8/15) * (3/2) * 25,000 = 20,000.\n\nAdding up all the shares, we get A's total share as 5000 + 8000 = 13,000, B's total share as 3750 + 4500 = 8250, and C's total share as 20,000.

            "Response": "Let's start by finding the total age of the 8 men before the women were included. Let's call this total X.\n\nX = (sum of ages of 8 men)\n\nNow, we know that when two women are included in place of two men of ages 20 and 10 years, the average age increases by 2 years. This means that the new total age of the 8 men and 2 women is:\n\nX + (age of woman 1) + (age of woman 2) - 20 - 10 = (sum of ages of 8 men and 2 women)\n\nWe subtract 20 and 10 because those are the ages of the two men who were replaced by the women.\n\nWe also know that the new average age is 2 years more than the old average age. So we can set up an equation:\n\n(sum of ages of 8 men and 2 women) / 10 = (X / 8) + 2\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns (the ages of the two women). We can solve for them using algebra.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the second equation:\n\n(sum of ages of 8 men and 2 women) / 10 = (X / 8) + 2\n\n(sum of ages of 8 men and 2 women) = (5/4)X + 40\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for (sum of ages of 8 men and 2 women) into the first equation:\n\nX + (age of woman 1) + (age of woman 2) - 20 - 10 = (5/4)X + 40\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(age of woman 1) + (age of woman 2) = (1/4)X + 70\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n(age of woman 1) + (age of woman 2) = (1/4)X + 70\n\nX + (age of woman 1) + (age of woman 2) - 20 - 10 = (5/4)X + 40\n\nWe can solve for X by subtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n-30 = (1/4)X - (5/4)X + 70 - 40\n\n-30 = -(4/4)X + 30\n\nX = 120\n\nNow we can substitute X = 120 into the equation for the sum of the ages of the women:\n\n(age of woman 1) + (age of woman 2) = (1/4)X + 70\n\n(age of woman 1) + (age of woman 2) = 30 + 70\n\n(age of woman 1) + (age of woman 2) = 100\n\nFinally, we can find the average age of the women by dividing their total age by 2:\n\n(average age of women) = (age of woman 1 + age of woman 2) / 2\n\n(average age of women) = 100 / 2\n\n(average age of women) = 50\n\nTherefore, the average age of the women is 50.

But this means Danny would only buy small LemonHead dolls, which contradicts the problem statement. \n\nIf n = 1, then x = 365/6 = 60.83, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf n = 2, then x = 365/7 = 52.14, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf n = 8, then x = 365/13 = 28.08, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf n = 30, then x = 365/35 = 10.43, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf n = 68, then x = 365/73 = 5, which is a whole number. \n\nTherefore, the cost of a large LemonHead doll is $5, which is option A.",

Let's call B's capital \"x\".\n\nSo, the total capital of the partnership is:\n\n2000 + x + C's capital\n\nNext, we need to find the total profit of the partnership. We know that the profit is Rs.600, but we don't know how it is divided among the partners. Let's call A's share of the profit \"a\", B's share \"b\", and C's share \"c\".\n\nSo, the total profit of the partnership is:\n\na + b + c = 600\n\nWe also know that A's share of the profit is Rs.200 and C's share is Rs.130. So, we can write:\n\na = 200\nc = 130\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for the total profit, we get:\n\n200 + b + 130 = 600\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nb = 270\n\nSo, B's share of the profit is Rs.270. Now we can use this information to find B's capital. We know that B's share of the profit is equal to his share of the total capital, multiplied by the profit margin. The profit margin is the ratio of the total profit to the total capital. So, we can write:\n\n270 = x / (2000 + x + 130) * 600\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n270 = x / (2130 + x) * 600\n\nMultiplying both sides by (2130 + x), we get:\n\n270 * (2130 + x) = x * 600\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n575100 + 270x = 600x\n\nSubtracting 270x from both sides, we get:\n\n575100 = 330x\n\nDividing both sides by 330, we get:\n\nx = 1750\n\nSo, B's capital is Rs.1750.

            "Response": "Let's assume that the total work is 40 units (since they can finish the work in 40 days together). \n\nIn the first 10 days, A and B worked together and completed a fraction of the work. Let's say they completed x units of work. \n\nSo, the remaining work is (40-x) units. \n\nNow, A worked alone for 12 days and completed a fraction of the remaining work. Let's say he completed y units of work. \n\nSo, the remaining work is (40-x-y) units. \n\nWe know that B worked for only 10 days, so his contribution to the total work is (10/40) = 1/4 of the work. \n\nTherefore, A and B together completed (1/4) of the work in the first 10 days. \n\nSo, we can write the equation: \n\nx/40 = 1/4 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 10 \n\nSo, A and B together completed 10 units of work in the first 10 days. \n\nNow, we know that A worked alone for 12 more days and completed y units of work. \n\nWe can write another equation: \n\ny/(40-10) = 3/4 \n\nSolving for y, we get: \n\ny = 24 \n\nSo, A completed 24 units of work in the next 12 days. \n\nTherefore, the total work completed by A alone is: \n\n10 + 24 = 34 units \n\nSince A can finish 34 units of work alone, and the total work is 40 units, A can finish the job alone in: \n\n(40/34) x 40 = 47.06 days (approx) \n\nSo, the closest option is E) 20 days.",
