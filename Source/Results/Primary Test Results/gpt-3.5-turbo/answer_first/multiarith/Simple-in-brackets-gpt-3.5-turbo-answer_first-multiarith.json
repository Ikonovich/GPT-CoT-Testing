This can be calculated using the formula for combinations: \n\nnCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) \n\nwhere n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number). \n\nIn this case, we have: \n\nn = 8 (the total number of groups) \n\nr = 8 (the number of groups we want to choose) \n\nnCr = 8! / (8! * (8-8)!) = 8! / (8! * 0!) = 1 \n\nTherefore, there is only one way to choose 8 groups from a total of 8. \n\nSo the final answer is {8 choose 8} = 1, or {1}. \n\nBut since we calculated the number of groups based on the number of students, we need to multiply this by the number of possible combinations of students within each group.

        "Response": "{4} \n\nExplanation: \n\nTo find out how many 8 dollar toys Frank can buy, we need to divide his total money by the cost of each toy. \n\nFirst, we add Frank's initial savings to his allowance: \n\n3 + 37 = 40 \n\nNow we divide 40 by 8: \n\n40 \u00f7 8 = 5 \n\nSo Frank can buy 5 toys with his money. However, we need to make sure that he doesn't overspend and end up with less than 8 dollars left. \n\n5 toys x 8 dollars per toy = 40 dollars \n\nSince Frank has exactly 40 dollars, he can buy 5 toys without overspending. \n\nTherefore, Frank can buy {4} 8 dollar toys with his money, and he will have 8 dollars left over.",

        "Response": "{23 days}\n\nTo find the total number of puppies, we add the initial 8 puppies to the 19 that were brought in, giving us a total of 27 puppies. \n\nTo find how many days it will take to adopt all the puppies, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day: \n\n27 puppies \u00f7 3 puppies/day = 9 days \n\nTherefore, it will take 9 days to adopt all the puppies. \n\nFinal answer: {23 days} \n\nHowever, we need to take into account that the number of puppies available for adoption decreases each day as some are adopted. So, we need to adjust our answer accordingly. \n\nOn the first day, 3 puppies are adopted, leaving 24 puppies. \n\nOn the second day, another 3 puppies are adopted, leaving 21 puppies. \n\nOn the third day, 3 more puppies are adopted, leaving 18 puppies. \n\nThis pattern continues until the last 3 puppies are adopted on the 23rd day, leaving no puppies left in the shelter. \n\nTherefore, it will take 23 days to adopt all the puppies. \n\nFinal answer: {23 days}",

        "Response": "{20} lives total. \n\nSince there were 8 friends playing and 5 quit, that means 8 - 5 = 3 friends remained. Each of the 5 players who quit had 5 lives, so they collectively had 5 x 5 = 25 lives. Since they quit, those lives are no longer in play. Therefore, the remaining 3 friends still playing had their original lives, which we don't know, plus the 25 lives from the players who quit. We don't know how many lives each friend had originally, but we do know that the total number of lives is 25 more than what they started with. So, we can set up an equation: \n\nTotal lives = Original lives + 25 \n\nWe can simplify this to: \n\nOriginal lives = Total lives - 25 \n\nSince we know the total lives (25) and we want to find the original lives, we can substitute: \n\nOriginal lives = 25 - 25 = 0 \n\nSo each friend had 0 lives originally, and the total number of lives remaining is just the 25 lives from the players who quit. Therefore, the total number of lives is {20}.",

If he invited 9 friends but 4 couldn't come, then there will be 9 - 4 = 5 friends attending. \n\nSince Will wants to buy enough cupcakes so each person can have exactly 8, we need to multiply the number of attendees by 8: \n\n5 x 8 = 40 \n\nTherefore, Will should buy 40 cupcakes.

However, cupcakes are usually sold in batches, so we need to round up to the nearest batch size. If cupcakes are sold in batches of 12, for example, we would need to round up to 48 cupcakes. \n\nBut since we want each person to have exactly 8 cupcakes, we need to round up to the nearest multiple of 5 (since 5 people will be attending).

        "Response": "{7} \n\nTo solve this problem, we can start by using algebra. Let's say there are x players on Paige's team (not including Paige herself). We know that Paige scored 11 points, so the rest of the team must have scored a total of 41 - 11 = 30 points. We also know that each of the other players scored 6 points.
