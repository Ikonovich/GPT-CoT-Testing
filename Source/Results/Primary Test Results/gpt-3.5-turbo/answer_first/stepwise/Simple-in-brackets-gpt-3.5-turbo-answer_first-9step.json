We rewrite the expression with this calculation substituted in:\n\n-8 - 10 + 3 + 6 + 2 - 6 + 2\n\nNext, we perform -8 - 10, which equals -18. We rewrite the expression with this calculation substituted in:\n\n-18 + 3 + 6 + 2 - 6 + 2\n\nNext, we perform 3 + 6, which equals 9. We rewrite the expression with this calculation substituted in:\n\n-18 + 9 + 2 - 6 + 2\n\nNext, we perform -18 + 9, which equals -9.
