        "Response": "The order of operations (PEMDAS) states that we must first perform any calculations inside parentheses, then exponents, then multiplication or division (from left to right), and finally addition or subtraction (from left to right). In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents, so we move on to multiplication and division. Again, there are none, so we move on to addition and subtraction. \n\nStarting from the left, we have 5 minus 7, which equals -2. Then we add 7 to -2, which gives us a final answer of 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is {5}.",
