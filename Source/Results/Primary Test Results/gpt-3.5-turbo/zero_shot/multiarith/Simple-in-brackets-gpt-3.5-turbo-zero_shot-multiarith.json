How much money did Roger actually earn, given that he only mowed 6 lawns? \n\nTo answer this, we can use multiplication again: \n\n9 dollars/lawn x 6 lawns = 54 dollars \n\nSo Roger actually earned 54 dollars. \n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\n126 dollars - (9 dollars/lawn x 8 lawns) = 126 dollars - 72 dollars = 54 dollars \n\nTherefore, Roger earned {54} dollars.",
