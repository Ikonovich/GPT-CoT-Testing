",
            "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks \"x\". Then, Friend P walks 15% faster, or 1.15x. Together, they will have walked the entire 43-km trail when they meet, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 1.15x = 43\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2.15x = 43\n\nx = 20\n\nSo Friend Q walks 20 km before they meet. To find out how far Friend P walks, we can use the fact that Friend P walks 15% faster than Friend Q:\n\n1.15x = 1.15(20) = 23\n\nTherefore, Friend P will have walked 23 km when they pass each other.

            "Response": "Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet's say that the current number of students per class is Q, and the current number of classes is C. Then, we know that the total number of students in the school is Q*C. \n\nIf the ratio of students per class were to be increased by 1, then the new number of students per class would be Q+1. We also know that there would be 10 fewer classes, so the new number of classes would be C-10. \n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of students in the school would still be 120. So we can set up an equation: \n\n(Q+1)*(C-10) = 120 \n\nExpanding the left side of the equation: \n\nQC - 10Q + C - 10 = 120 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nQC - 10Q + C = 130 \n\nFactoring out a Q: \n\nQ(C-10) + C = 130 \n\nWe know that Q*C = the total number of students in the school, so we can substitute that in: \n\nQ(C-10) + C = 130 \n\nQC - 10Q + C = 130 \n\nQC + C = 10Q + 130 \n\nC(Q+1) = 10(Q+13) \n\nC = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) \n\nWe know that C is a whole number, so Q+1 must be a factor of 10(Q+13).

We also know that Q is a positive integer, so Q+1 must be greater than 1. \n\nLet's try each factor and see which one gives us a whole number for C: \n\nIf Q+1 = 2, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 130, which is a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 5, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 65, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 10, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 30, which is a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = Q+13, then Q = -12, which is not a positive integer. \n\nIf Q+1 = 2(Q+13), then Q = 23, which is a positive integer. But C = 5, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 5(Q+13), then Q = 12, which is a positive integer. But C = 3, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 10(Q+13), then Q = 7, which is a positive integer. But C = 2, which is not a whole number. \n\nSo the only factor that works is Q+1 = 2.

            "Response": "Let's first find the total work to be done. We can do this by using the formula:\n\nTotal work = (number of people) x (time taken) / (efficiency)\n\nEfficiency is the amount of work done by one person in one day. We don't know the efficiency, but we can assume it to be the same for women and children.\n\nFor 10 women to complete the work in 9 days, we have:\n\nTotal work = 10 x 9 / (efficiency of one woman)\n\nFor 10 children to complete the work in 12 days, we have:\n\nTotal work = 10 x 12 / (efficiency of one child)\n\nSince the total work is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions:\n\n10 x 9 / (efficiency of one woman) = 10 x 12 / (efficiency of one child)\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n(efficiency of one child) = 3/4 x (efficiency of one woman)\n\nNow, let's find the time taken by 6 women and 7 children to complete the work. Using the same formula as before, we have:\n\nTotal work = (6 women + 7 children) x (time taken) / (efficiency)\n\nSubstituting the efficiency from above, we get:\n\nTotal work = (6 women + 7 children) x (time taken) / (3/4 x efficiency of one woman)\n\nCanceling out the common factor of efficiency of one woman, we get:\n\nTotal work = (6 women + 7 children) x (4/3 x time taken)\n\nNow, we can equate the total work from the first part to the total work in this part:\n\n10 x 9 = (6 women + 7 children) x (4/3 x time taken)\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\ntime taken = 10 x 9 / (6 women + 7 children) x (4/3)\n\ntime taken = 30 / (6 women + 7 children)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of (6 women + 7 children). We can use the efficiency formula again to do this:\n\n6 women = (efficiency of one woman) x (time taken) / 6\n\n7 children = (efficiency of one child) x (time taken) / 7\n\nSubstituting the efficiency ratio from above, we get:\n\n6 women = (4/3 x efficiency of one woman) x (time taken) / 6\n\n7 children = (3/4 x efficiency of one woman) x (time taken) / 7\n\nCanceling out the common factor of time taken, we get:\n\n6 women = 2/3 x efficiency of one woman\n\n7 children = 21/28 x efficiency of one woman\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\n6 women + 7 children = 2/3 x efficiency of one woman + 21/28 x efficiency of one woman\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n6 women + 7 children = 87/84 x efficiency of one woman\n\nNow, substituting this value in the time taken formula, we get:\n\ntime taken = 30 / (87/84 x efficiency of one woman) x (4/3)\n\ntime taken = 5\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B) 5.",

            "Response": "The length of the platform is given by:\nLength = Speed x Time taken to pass the platform\nLet's first convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s:\n54 km/hr = (54 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 15 m/s\nNow, let's consider the time taken by the train to pass the platform. During this time, the front of the train travels a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the platform. So, let's assume that the length of the platform is L meters. Then, we can write:\nL + length of train = speed x time taken by train to pass the platform\nL + length of train = 15 x 32\nL + length of train = 480\nSimilarly, during the time taken by the man to be passed by the train, the front of the train travels a distance equal to its own length.

So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 2 is 6*5*4*3 = 360.\n\nCase 2: First digit is 3\nIn this case, we have 5 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding 3 and the digit used as the first digit), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 3 is 5*4*3 = 60.\n\nCase 3: First digit is 4\nIn this case, we have 5 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding 4 and the digit used as the first digit), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 4 is 5*4*3 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the total number of numbers that can be formed greater than 1 lakh is 360 + 60 + 60 = 480.\nBut we have to remember that we have used two 2's, two 3's, and two 4's. So, we have to subtract the cases where we have used both the same digits.\nCase 4: Both the same digits are 2\nIn this case, we have 4 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding the two 2's), 3 digits for the third digit, and 2 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 22 is 4*3*2 = 24.\n\nCase 5: Both the same digits are 3\nIn this case, we have 3 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding the two 3's), 2 digits for the third digit, and 1 digit for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 33 is 3*2*1 = 6.\n\nCase 6: Both the same digits are 4\nIn this case, we have 3 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding the two 4's), 2 digits for the third digit, and 1 digit for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 44 is 3*2*1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of numbers that can be formed greater than 1 lakh and with distinct digits is 480 - 24 - 6 - 6 = 444.\nBut we have to remember that we can arrange the digits in 5! ways. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed greater than 1 lakh and with distinct digits is 444*5! = 26,640.\nBut we have to add the cases where we have used only one of the same digits.\nCase 7: One of the same digits is 2\nIn this case, we have 2 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding one of the 2's), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 2 is 2*4*3 = 24.\n\nCase 8: One of the same digits is 3\nIn this case, we have 2 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding one of the 3's), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 3 is 2*4*3 = 24.\n\nCase 9: One of the same digits is 4\nIn this case, we have 2 digits to choose from for the second digit (excluding one of the 4's), 4 digits for the third digit, and 3 digits for the fourth digit. So, the total number of numbers that can be formed starting with 4 is 2*4*3 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the total number of numbers that can be formed greater than 1 lakh is 26,640 + 24 + 24 + 24 = 26,712.\nBut we have to remember that we have counted the number 22234 twice (once in case 1 and once in case 7).

",
            "Response": "Option D) p > q is correct.\n\nExplanation:\nLet the percentage increase in the number of livestock during the year 2000 be p%. Then, the number of livestock at the end of 2000 is:\n\n130,000 + (p/100)*130,000 = 130,000*(1 + p/100)\n\nDuring the year 2001, the number of livestock decreased by q%.

Therefore, we have:\n\n130,000*(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100) = 130,000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100) = 1\n\n1 - (q/100) + (p/100) - (p*q/10,000) = 1\n\n(p/100) - (q/100) - (p*q/10,000) = 0\n\np - q - (p*q/100) = 0\n\np - (p*q/100) = q\n\np*(100-q) = q*100\n\np/q = 100/(100-q)\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that p is greater than q if and only if q is less than 100.

            "Response": "The key to solving this problem is to use the concept of \"man-days\" and \"woman-days.\" If 3 men can reap a field in 10 days, then they can reap 1/30 of the field in one day (since 3 men x 10 days = 30 man-days). Similarly, if 4 women can reap a field in 10 days, then they can reap 1/40 of the field in one day (since 4 women x 10 days = 40 woman-days).\n\nTo find out how long it will take 5 men and 6 women to reap the field, we need to add up their man-days and woman-days and see how many days it will take them to reap the whole field. \n\n5 men x 1/30 of the field in one day = 1/6 of the field in one day (since 5 men x 1/30 = 1/6)\n6 women x 1/40 of the field in one day = 3/40 of the field in one day (since 6 women x 1/40 = 3/40)\n\nSo, together, 5 men and 6 women can reap 1/6 + 3/40 of the field in one day. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 40. \n\n1/6 = 6/40\n3/40 = 3/40\n\nSo, together, 5 men and 6 women can reap (6/40) + (3/40) = 9/40 of the field in one day. \n\nTo reap the whole field, they need to do 1 job, which is equivalent to 40/40 of the field. \n\nSo, the number of days it will take them to reap the field is:\n\n(40/40) / (9/40) = 40/9 days\n\nThis is equivalent to 4 and 4/9 days, or approximately 4.44 days. \n\nTherefore, the answer is not one of the options provided.",

            "Response": "Answer: D) 7\n\nExplanation: \nTo determine which of the given options cannot be a divisor of y, we need to substitute y = 3x + 2 into each option and check if it results in an integer.\n\nA) 4: If 4 is a divisor of y, then y must be even. This means 3x + 2 must be even, which is true for all integers x. Therefore, 4 can be a divisor of y.\n\nB) 5: If 5 is a divisor of y, then y must end in either 0 or 5. However, 3x + 2 can never end in 5, so 5 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nC) 6: If 6 is a divisor of y, then y must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Since 3x + 2 is always odd, y can never be divisible by 2. Therefore, 6 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nD) 7: If 7 is a divisor of y, then we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we double the last digit of a number and subtract it from the remaining digits, the result must be divisible by 7. Applying this rule to 3x + 2, we get (3x - 1) + 3 = 3(x+1). Since we cannot apply the rule again to 3(x+1), we cannot determine if 7 is a divisor of y. Therefore, it is possible that 7 is not a divisor of y.\n\nE) 8: If 8 is a divisor of y, then y must be divisible by both 2 and 4. Since 3x + 2 is always odd, y can never be divisible by 2. Therefore, 8 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 7, as it cannot be determined if 7 is a divisor of y using the given information.",

To make the denominator an integer, we need to cancel out all the factors of 2 and 3 in the product of all positive integers less than 31. We can do this by dividing out all the even numbers and all the multiples of 3. However, we need to be careful not to divide out any number twice (i.e. any multiple of 6).

The greatest power of 2 that divides the numerator is $2^3$, so we need $2^{15-3}=2^{12}$ to divide $S/18^k$. For this to happen, we need to divide out all the even numbers up to $2\\cdot12=24$.

            "Response": "When two trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. \n\nHere, the relative speed of the two trains = (60 + 90) kmph = 150 kmph = (150 x 5/18) m/s = 125/3 m/s \n\nLet's assume that the two trains meet at time t after they start moving. \n\nIn that time, the first train would have covered a distance of 111t meters, and the second train would have covered a distance of 165t meters. \n\nThe total distance covered by the two trains before they are completely clear of each other = 111t + 165t = 276t meters \n\nWe want to find the time taken for the two trains to be completely clear of each other, i.e., the time taken for them to cover a distance of 111 + 165 = 276 meters. \n\nUsing the formula distance = speed x time, we can write: \n\n276 = (125/3) x t \n\nSolving for t, we get: \n\nt = 276 x 3/125 = 6.62 seconds \n\nTherefore, the two trains will be completely clear of each other 6.62 seconds after they meet. \n\nHence, the answer is option E) 6.62.",

When we multiplied both sides by 35*49, we assumed that the number of pastry goods sold would be the same in both scenarios (dividing equally among 35 customers and giving 6 less to 49 customers). But this isn't necessarily true - the confectioner might need to sell more pastry goods to make up for the 6 less each customer will receive if there are 49 customers. \n\nLet's try again, but this time we'll call the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell \"y\" in the second scenario (49 customers receiving 6 less each). \n\nIf he divides it equally among 35 regular customers, each customer will receive y/35-6 pastry goods. \n\nWe can set up an equation: \n\ny/35-6 = x/35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35 gives: \n\ny-210 = x \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\nx = y-210 \n\ny/35-6 = x/35 \n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second: \n\ny/35-6 = (y-210)/35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35 gives: \n\ny-210 = y-7350/35 \n\nSimplifying: \n\ny-210 = y-210 \n\nThis is true for any value of y! So we don't have a unique solution. \n\nHowever, we can still answer the question by finding the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell in either scenario. \n\nIf he divides it equally among 35 regular customers, each customer will receive x/35 pastry goods. So the total amount of pastry goods he needs to sell is: \n\nx = 35 * (amount each customer receives) \n\nWe can use either equation to find the amount each customer receives. Let's use the second equation: \n\ny/35-6 = x/35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35 gives: \n\ny-210 = x \n\nSubstituting x = 35 * (y/35-6): \n\ny-210 = 35 * (y/35-6) \n\nSimplifying: \n\ny-210 = y-210 \n\nThis is true for any value of y, so we still don't have a unique solution. \n\nHowever, we can use the answer choices to help us. We know that the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell is a multiple of 35 (since he's dividing it equally among 35 customers). \n\nThe only answer choice that's a multiple of 35 is A) 525. So let's see if that works. \n\nIf he sells 525 pastry goods and divides them equally among 35 customers, each customer will receive 525/35 = 15 pastry goods. \n\nIf only 49 customers come, each customer will receive 15-6 = 9 pastry goods. \n\nSo the total number of pastry goods given to customers is: \n\n35 * 15 = 525 \n\n49 * 9 = 441 \n\nTotal: 525 + 441 = 966 \n\nThis matches the total number of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell (525), so the answer is A) 525.",

Therefore, we draw radii from the center of the quarter circle to the two points of tangency of the inscribed circle.

Therefore, the total initial volume of the mixture is 5x, which is equal to 30 liters.

Let's assume that we need to add y liters of Liquid Q. Therefore, the new amount of Liquid Q in the mixture will be 12 + y liters, and the new amount of Liquid P will still be 18 liters.\n\nThe new ratio of Liquid P to Liquid Q will be 3:4, which means that:\n\nLiquid P/Liquid Q = 3/4\n\nSubstituting the new amounts of Liquid P and Liquid Q, we get:\n\n18/(12+y) = 3/4\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n54 + 3y = 48\n\n3y = -6\n\ny = -2\n\nThis means that we need to add 2 liters of Liquid Q to the mixture to make the ratio 3:4.

            "Response": "Option B) 9\n\nTo find the square root of 3,969, we can use a calculator or long division method. However, we can also simplify 3,969 by breaking it down into its prime factors: \n\n3,969 = 3 x 3 x 13 x 17 \n\nTaking the square root of each factor, we get: \n\n\u221a3 x \u221a3 x \u221a13 x \u221a17 \n\nSimplifying further, we can combine the two \u221a3 terms: \n\n\u221a(3 x 3 x 13 x 17) \n\nWhich equals: \n\n\u221a111111 \n\nNow, we can use long division to find the square root of 111111. \n\nStarting with the largest perfect square less than 111111, which is 10000, we get: \n\n\u221a111111 = \u221a(10000 + 11111) \n\n= \u221a10000 + \u221a11111 \n\n= 100 + \u221a(10000 + 1111) \n\n= 100 + \u221a11100 \n\n= 100 + 10\u221a111 \n\nSince 111 is not a perfect square, we cannot simplify further. Therefore, the square root of 3,969 is approximately 100 + 10\u221a111 or approximately 100 + 10(10.54) = 100 + 105.4 = 205.4. \n\nHowever, since none of the answer choices are close to 205.4, we can assume that the question is asking for the simplified exact answer, which is \u221a111111 = 100 + 10\u221a111 = 9.",

Let's assume that Usha and Shiny run at the same speed, then the time taken by Shiny to complete the race is 1000 m divided by the speed of Shiny. \n\nLet's calculate the speed of Usha and Shiny: \n\nSpeed of Usha = 1000 m / (time taken by Usha) \n\nSpeed of Shiny = 1000 m / (time taken by Shiny) \n\nSince Usha beats Shiny by 50 m, we can say that Usha covers 1050 m in the same time that Shiny covers 1000 m. \n\nTherefore, \n\n1000 m / (speed of Shiny) = 1050 m / (speed of Usha) \n\nSpeed of Usha = (1050/1000) x (speed of Shiny) \n\nSpeed of Usha = 1.05 x (speed of Shiny) \n\nNow we can substitute the speed of Usha in terms of the speed of Shiny in the equation for time: \n\n1000 m / (speed of Shiny) = (1000 m / (1.05 x speed of Shiny)) + (50 m / speed of Usha) \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n1000 = 952.38 + (47.62 / speed of Shiny) \n\n47.62 / speed of Shiny = 47.62 \n\nSpeed of Shiny = 1 m/s \n\nNow we can calculate the time taken by Shiny to complete the race: \n\nTime taken by Shiny = 1000 m / (speed of Shiny) = 1000 seconds \n\nFinally, we can calculate the time margin by which Shiny beats Mercy: \n\nTime taken by Mercy = 1000 m / 4 m/s = 250 seconds \n\nTime margin = Time taken by Shiny - Time taken by Mercy = 1000 seconds - 250 seconds = 750 seconds = 12.5 minutes \n\nTherefore, the answer is E) None of these.",
