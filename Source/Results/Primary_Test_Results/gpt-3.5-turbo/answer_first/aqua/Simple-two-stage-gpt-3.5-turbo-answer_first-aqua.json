            "Response": "Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. \n\nLet's say that the current number of students per class is Q, and the current number of classes is C. Then, we know that the total number of students in the school is Q*C. \n\nIf the ratio of students per class were to be increased by 1, then the new number of students per class would be Q+1. We also know that there would be 10 fewer classes, so the new number of classes would be C-10. \n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of students in the school would still be 120. So we can set up an equation: \n\n(Q+1)*(C-10) = 120 \n\nExpanding the left side of the equation: \n\nQC - 10Q + C - 10 = 120 \n\nSimplifying: \n\nQC - 10Q + C = 130 \n\nFactoring out a Q: \n\nQ(C-10) + C = 130 \n\nWe know that Q*C = the total number of students in the school, so we can substitute that in: \n\nQ(C-10) + C = 130 \n\nQC - 10Q + C = 130 \n\nQC + C = 10Q + 130 \n\nC(Q+1) = 10(Q+13) \n\nC = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) \n\nWe know that C is a whole number, so Q+1 must be a factor of 10(Q+13). The factors of 10(Q+13) are: \n\n1, 2, 5, 10, Q+13, 2(Q+13), 5(Q+13), 10(Q+13) \n\nWe can eliminate the factors that are not Q+1: \n\n1, 2, 5, 10, Q+13, 2(Q+13), 5(Q+13), 10(Q+13) \n\nSo Q+1 must be one of these factors. We also know that Q is a positive integer, so Q+1 must be greater than 1. \n\nLet's try each factor and see which one gives us a whole number for C: \n\nIf Q+1 = 2, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 130, which is a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 5, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 65, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 10, then C = 10(Q+13)/(Q+1) = 30, which is a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = Q+13, then Q = -12, which is not a positive integer. \n\nIf Q+1 = 2(Q+13), then Q = 23, which is a positive integer. But C = 5, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 5(Q+13), then Q = 12, which is a positive integer. But C = 3, which is not a whole number. \n\nIf Q+1 = 10(Q+13), then Q = 7, which is a positive integer. But C = 2, which is not a whole number. \n\nSo the only factor that works is Q+1 = 2. This means that Q = 1, and the current ratio of students per class is Q = 3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A) Q=3.",

Dividing both sides by abc gives 1/c + 1/b + 1/a = 1/abc, which means that abc must be greater than 1. \n\nSince a, b, and c are positive integers, we know that abc is at least 2. Therefore, we can start by trying a = 1, which gives 1/b + 1/c = 1. Multiplying both sides by bc gives bc - b - c = 0, which can be factored as (b - 1)(c - 1) = 1.

We can use the complement rule and find the probability that no customer bought a coffee and a bagel:\n\nP(no coffee and bagel) = P(only bagel) + P(only coffee) + P(neither)\n\nP(neither) is the probability that a customer bought neither a coffee nor a bagel, which is:\n\nP(neither) = 1 - P(bagel) - P(coffee) + P(bagel and coffee) = 1 - (3/5) - (5/7) + (3/5) x (number of customers who bought both / 5)\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least 1 customer bought a coffee and a bagel:\n\nP(at least 1 coffee and bagel) = 1 - P(no coffee and bagel)\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can assume that the number of customers who bought both is the same as the number of customers who bought only a coffee or only a bagel. This is a reasonable assumption since we don't have any information about the actual numbers. With this assumption, we can calculate:\n\nP(bagel and coffee) = (3/5) x (number of customers who bought both / 5) = (3/25)\n\nP(only bagel) = (3/5) - (3/25) = (12/25)\n\nP(only coffee) = (5/7) - (3/25) = (116/175)\n\nP(neither) = 1 - (3/5) - (5/7) + (3/25) = (27/35)\n\nP(no coffee and bagel) = (12/25) + (116/175) + (27/35) = (199/245)\n\nP(at least 1 coffee and bagel) = 1 - (199/245) = 46/245\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 27/343.",

            "Response": "The answer is D) 90.\n\nTo see why, we can use a simple formula: the number of handshakes is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 people out of a group of n people, which is given by the formula n(n-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, there are 9 people, so the number of handshakes is 9(9-1)/2 = 9(8)/2 = 36.\n\nHowever, we have to remember that each handshake involves two people, so we have counted each handshake twice (once for each person involved). Therefore, we need to divide the total number of handshakes by 2 to get the actual number of unique handshakes. 36/2 = 18.\n\nSo the final answer is 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45.",

",
            "Response": "Let the consumption of diesel per hour at a speed of x kmph be y litres. Then, we have:\n\ny = kx^2\n\nwhere k is the constant of proportionality. We can find the value of k by using the given information that when the bus is travelling at 60 kmph, its consumption is 1 litre per hour:\n\n1 = k(60)^2\nk = 1/3600\n\nSo, the consumption of diesel per hour at a speed of x kmph is:\n\ny = (1/3600)x^2\n\nNow, let's find the total cost of covering a distance of 600 km. We know that the time taken to cover a distance of d km at a speed of x kmph is:\n\nt = d/x\n\nSo, the total consumption of diesel during this time is:\n\ny*t = (1/3600)x^2 * (d/x) = (d/3600)x litres\n\nThe cost of this diesel is:\n\n(d/3600)x * $60 = (d/60)x dollars\n\nIn addition, there is a fixed cost of $60 per hour. So, the total cost of covering a distance of 600 km at a speed of x kmph is:\n\nC(x) = (d/60)x + 600\n\nSubstituting d = 600 km, we get:\n\nC(x) = 10x + 600\n\nWe want to minimize this cost, so we take the derivative with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n\nC'(x) = 10 = 0\nx = 0\n\nThis is a minimum because the second derivative is positive (C''(x) = 0). However, this solution doesn't make sense because the bus cannot travel at 0 kmph. So, we need to check the endpoints of the feasible range of speeds, which is [0, infinity). The lower endpoint is not feasible, so we only need to check the upper endpoint:\n\nC(infinity) = 10(infinity) + 600 = infinity\n\nThis is not a minimum because the cost keeps increasing as the speed increases. Therefore, the minimum cost occurs at some intermediate speed. To find this speed, we can use the fact that the consumption of diesel per hour varies directly as the square of the speed. This means that if we double the speed, the consumption increases by a factor of 4. So, we want to find the speed that is half of 60 kmph, which is 30 kmph. At this speed, the consumption is:\n\ny = (1/3600)(30)^2 = 1/4 litre per hour\n\nThe total consumption of diesel for covering a distance of 600 km at this speed is:\n\n(600/3600)(30) = 10 litres\n\nThe cost of this diesel is:\n\n10 * $60 = $600\n\nIn addition, there is a fixed cost of $60 per hour, and the total time taken is:\n\nt = 600/30 = 20 hours\n\nSo, the total cost is:\n\nC = $600 + $60 * 20 = $1800\n\nTherefore, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is $1800, which is option (C).",

Therefore, we can divide the 24 hours into two equal intervals of 12 hours each.\n\nNow, we can take two mice and label them as M1 and M2. We will give M1 a sample from the first 15 cans and M2 a sample from the remaining 15 cans. This way, if one of the samples is poisoned, we can narrow it down to 15 cans.\n\nAfter 12 hours, we can check the condition of both mice. If M1 is dead, then the poisoned can is in the first 15 cans, otherwise, it is in the second 15 cans. Similarly, if M2 is dead, then the poisoned can is in the second 15 cans, otherwise, it is in the first 15 cans.\n\nNow, we can repeat the same process with two more mice, giving them samples from the 15 cans that are suspected to be poisoned.

            "Response": "Answer: C) 5\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet the sum of the first 6 observations be S. Then, we have:\n\nS/6 = 11\n\nS = 66\n\nLet the seventh observation be x. Then, we have:\n\n(S+x)/7 = 10\n\nSubstituting the value of S, we get:\n\n(66+x)/7 = 10\n\n66+x = 70\n\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, the seventh observation is 4. However, we need to find the observation that will decrease the average by 1. Since the current average is 11, the new average should be 10.

This means that the seventh observation should be:\n\n60 - 4 = 56\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options. Therefore, we need to check which option will give us a sum of 60 when added to the sum of the first 6 observations.

            "Response": "The answer is D) 3, 9 and 37.\n\nTo find the numbers that can divide all nine three-digit numbers, we need to find the common factors of these numbers. \n\nFirst, we can see that all of these numbers are divisible by 111, since they are all multiples of 111. So any number that can divide 111 will also divide all of these numbers. \n\nNext, we can look for other factors that are common to all of these numbers. One such factor is 3, since the sum of the digits of each number is a multiple of 3. \n\nFinally, we can check for other factors by adding up the digits of each number and checking if the sum is divisible by any other numbers. For example, the sum of the digits of 444 is 4+4+4=12, which is divisible by 3 and 4. However, not all of the numbers have a sum of digits that is divisible by the same number, so we need to check each number individually. \n\nAfter checking all of the numbers, we find that the only other factor that is common to all of them is 9.

Then we have:\n\n$A = $B + $2,000\n\nIn the first month, Store A's revenues were $40,000 higher than Store B's revenues. Let Store B's revenue in the first month be $x. Then Store A's revenue in the first month is $x + $40,000. \n\nIn the second month, Store A's revenues were $6,000 higher than Store B's revenues. Let Store B's revenue in the second month be $y. Then Store A's revenue in the second month is $y + $6,000.\n\nWe know that the average monthly revenue for Store A over the three months is $A, so:\n\n($x + $40,000 + $y + $6,000 + z)/3 = $A\n\nwhere z is the revenue for Store A in the third month and $z > $y.\n\nSimilarly, we know that the average monthly revenue for Store B over the three months is $B, so:\n\n($x + $y + z)/3 = $B\n\nWe can simplify the first equation to:\n\n($x + $y + $z)/3 + $15,333.33 = $A\n\nSubstituting $A = $B + $2,000, we get:\n\n($x + $y + $z)/3 + $15,333.33 = $B + $2,000\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n($x + $y + $z)/3 = $B - $13,333.33\n\nSubstituting the second equation, we get:\n\n($x + $y + z)/3 = $B - $13,333.33\n\n($x + $y + z)/3 = $B - $13,333.33\n\n($x + $y + z) = $B($39,999.99)\n\nWe know that Store A's revenue in the third month is less than Store B's revenue in the third month, so:\n\n$z < $y + $6,000 + $2,000\n\n$z < $y + $8,000\n\nSubstituting $z = $B($39,999.99) - $x - $y, we get:\n\n$B($39,999.99) - $x - $y < $y + $8,000\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$B($39,999.99) < $x + 2$y + $8,000\n\nWe know that $x + $y + $z = 3$B, so:\n\n$B($39,999.99) < 3$B - $x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$B($39,999.99) + $x < 3$B\n\nWe also know that $x + $y + $z = 3$B, so:\n\n$z = 2$B - $x$\n\nSubstituting into the inequality, we get:\n\n$B($39,999.99) + $x < 3$B\n\n$B($39,999.99) + $x < $x + $y + $z\n\n$B($39,999.99) < $y + $z\n\n$B($39,999.99) < 3$B - $x\n\n$2$B > $x($39,999.99)\n\n$B > $x($19,999.995)\n\nSince $B$ and $x$ are both positive, we can divide both sides by $x$:\n\n$B/x > $19,999.995\n\nWe know that $B/x$ is the ratio of Store B's revenue to Store B's revenue in the first month.

            "Response": "The key to solving this problem is to use the concept of \"man-days\" and \"woman-days.\" If 3 men can reap a field in 10 days, then they can reap 3 x 10 = 30 man-days worth of work. Similarly, if 4 women can reap a field in 10 days, then they can reap 4 x 10 = 40 woman-days worth of work.\n\nTo find out how long it will take 5 men and 6 women to reap the field, we need to first calculate their combined man-days and woman-days. 5 men can do 5 x t man-days of work in t days, and 6 women can do 6 x t woman-days of work in t days. So, in t days, the combined man-days and woman-days will be:\n\n5t (for the men) + 6t (for the women) = 11t\n\nNow, we know that 3 men can do 30 man-days of work in 10 days, which means that 1 man can do 10 man-days of work in 10 days. Similarly, we know that 4 women can do 40 woman-days of work in 10 days, which means that 1 woman can do 10 woman-days of work in 10 days.\n\nTherefore, in 10 days, 5 men and 6 women can do:\n\n5 x 10 (man-days) + 6 x 10 (woman-days) = 50 + 60 = 110\n\nman-woman days of work. To find out how long it will take them to do 110 man-woman days of work, we divide by their combined man-woman days per day:\n\n11t / (5 + 6) = 11t / 11 = t\n\nSo, it will take them t = 1 day to do 110 man-woman days of work.

This means 3x + 2 must be even, which is true for all integers x. Therefore, 4 can be a divisor of y.\n\nB) 5: If 5 is a divisor of y, then y must end in either 0 or 5. However, 3x + 2 can never end in 5, so 5 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nC) 6: If 6 is a divisor of y, then y must be divisible by both 2 and 3. Since 3x + 2 is always odd, y can never be divisible by 2 and 6 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nD) 7: If 7 is a divisor of y, then we can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we double the last digit of a number and subtract it from the remaining digits, the result must be divisible by 7. Applying this rule to 3x + 2, we get (3x - 1) + 3 = 3(x+1). Since we cannot apply the rule again, we cannot determine if 3(x+1) is divisible by 7. Therefore, 7 may or may not be a divisor of y.\n\nE) 8: If 8 is a divisor of y, then y must be divisible by 8. Since 3x + 2 can never be divisible by 8, 8 cannot be a divisor of y.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 7, as it may or may not be a divisor of y.",

            "Response": "The prime factorization of 18 is $2\\cdot3^2$. To make the denominator an integer, we need to cancel out all the factors of 2 and 3 in the product of all positive integers less than 31. We can do this by dividing out all the even numbers and all the multiples of 3. However, we need to be careful not to divide out any factors of 3 twice (i.e. we only want to divide out one factor of 3 from each multiple of 3). \n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{30}{2}\\right\\rfloor=15$ even numbers less than 31. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{30}{3}\\right\\rfloor=10$ multiples of 3 less than 31, but we need to subtract off the multiples of 6 to avoid dividing out any factors of 3 twice. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{30}{6}\\right\\rfloor=5$ multiples of 6 less than 31. Therefore, we need to divide out a total of $15+10-5=20$ factors of 2 and 3. \n\nSince $18=2\\cdot3^2$, we can divide out a factor of 18 for every two factors of 2 and every two factors of 3. Therefore, we can divide out $k$ factors of 18 if we can divide out $2k$ factors of 2 and $2k$ factors of 3.

The capacity of tank B can't be negative!\nWhat went wrong?\nWell, we made an assumption earlier that it takes a finite amount of time to fill tank B completely. But that assumption may not be true. It's possible that tank B can never be completely filled, because the amount of water going into it keeps increasing at a faster and faster rate, while the capacity of the tank remains fixed.\nLet's try to prove this.\nWe know that the total amount of water that goes into tank B in n hours is:\nS = 10 + 20 + 40 + 80 + 160 + ...

So, we can write:\nlim S = lim 20(2^n)\nn->inf n->inf\nThis limit does not exist, because 20(2^n) grows without bound as n gets larger and larger.\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means that the total amount of water going into tank B keeps increasing without bound, while the capacity of the tank remains fixed.

            "Response": "The pasture is rented for 10 months, and A uses it for 7 months, leaving 3 months for B to use. Let's assume that A pays $x for the rent of the pasture. Then B pays half as much again, which means he pays $x + (1/2)x = (3/2)x.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many cows B can put in for 3 months. We know that A put in 80 cows for 7 months, which means he put in a total of 80 x 7 = 560 cow-months (since one cow for one month is one cow-month). Therefore, the total number of cow-months for the pasture is 10x.\n\nB will be using the pasture for 3 months, so he needs to put in enough cows to make up 3/10 of the total cow-months. Let's call the number of cows B puts in y. Then we can set up the equation:\n\ny x 3 = (3/10) x 10x - 560\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3y = 3x - 560\ny = x - 187.33\n\nBut we also know that B pays (3/2)x for the rent, so we can set up another equation:\n\n(3/2)x = y x r\n\nwhere r is the rent per cow-month that B pays. Substituting y = x - 187.33, we get:\n\n(3/2)x = (x - 187.33) x r\nr = (3/2)x / (x - 187.33)\nr = 1.5 / (1 - 187.33/x)\n\nNow we can substitute the value of x into this equation (we don't know the exact value of x, but we don't need it to find the answer). We get:\n\nr = 1.5 / (1 - 187.33/x) = 1.5 / (1 - 187.33/80) = 1.5 / 0.66875 = 2.2418\n\nTherefore, B pays $2.2418 per cow-month. To find out how many cows he can put in for 3 months, we need to divide the total amount he pays by the rent per cow-month:\n\n(3/2)x = y x r\ny = (3/2)x / r = (3/2)x / 2.2418 = 0.66875x\n\nNow we can substitute the value of x into this equation to get the answer:\n\ny = 0.66875x = 0.66875 x 80 = 53.5\n\nTherefore, B can put in 53 cows for the remaining 3 months.

            "Response": "We can use complementary counting to solve this problem. First, we count the total number of outcomes, which is $6!=720$. Then, we count the number of outcomes where neither Team A nor Team B wins a prize. There are 4 remaining teams, so there are $4!=24$ ways to rank them. However, we must multiply by 2 because either Team A or Team B could have won a prize, so there are $2\\cdot24=48$ outcomes where neither Team A nor Team B wins a prize.\n\nTherefore, the number of outcomes where either Team A or Team B wins a prize is $720-48=672$. We can split this into two cases:\n\nCase 1: Team A wins the $5,000$ prize. Then, Team B must win either the $3,000$ or $2,000$ prize. There are 2 ways to choose which prize Team B wins, and there are $4\\cdot3=12$ ways to rank the remaining teams (since there are 4 teams left and the highest two prizes are taken). Therefore, there are $2\\cdot12=24$ outcomes in this case.\n\nCase 2: Team B wins the $3,000$ prize. Then, Team A must win the $5,000$ prize, and there are $4\\cdot2=8$ ways to rank the remaining teams. Therefore, there are $8$ outcomes in this case.\n\nAdding up the outcomes from both cases, we get $24+8=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }18}$ as our final answer.",

            "Response": "Let's call the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell \"x\". \n\nIf he divides it equally among 35 regular customers, each customer will receive x/35 pastry goods. \n\nIf only 49 customers come, each customer will receive (x/35)-6 pastry goods. \n\nWe can set up an equation: \n\n(x/35)-6 = x/49 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35*49 (the least common multiple of 35 and 49) gives: \n\n49x - 35*6*x = 35*49*x \n\nSimplifying: \n\n49x - 210x = 1715x \n\n-161x = 0 \n\nx = 0 \n\nThis doesn't make sense - it means the confectioner doesn't need to sell any pastry goods at all! \n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our equation. When we multiplied both sides by 35*49, we assumed that the number of pastry goods sold would be the same in both scenarios (dividing equally among 35 customers and giving 6 less to 49 customers). But this isn't necessarily true - the confectioner might need to sell more pastry goods to make up for the 6 less each customer will receive if there are 49 customers. \n\nLet's try again, but this time we'll call the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell \"y\" in the second scenario (49 customers receiving 6 less each). \n\nIf he divides it equally among 35 regular customers, each customer will receive y/35-6 pastry goods. \n\nWe can set up an equation: \n\ny/35-6 = x/35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35 gives: \n\ny-210 = x \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\nx = y-210 \n\ny/35-6 = x/35 \n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second: \n\ny/35-6 = (y-210)/35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35 gives: \n\ny-210 = y-7350/35 \n\nSimplifying: \n\ny-210 = y-210 \n\nThis is true for any value of y! So we can't solve for y directly. \n\nHowever, we can use the fact that y represents the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell in the second scenario (49 customers receiving 6 less each). We know that if there were 35 customers, each would receive y/35 pastry goods. So: \n\n35(y/35) = x \n\nSimplifying: \n\ny = x \n\nSo the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell is the same in both scenarios. \n\nWe can use either equation to solve for it: \n\nx = y-210 \n\nx = (y/35-6)*35 \n\nSetting these equal to each other: \n\ny-210 = (y/35-6)*35 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35: \n\n35y-7350 = y*35-210*35 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n35y-7350 = 35y-7350 \n\nThis is true for any value of y! So again, we can't solve for y directly. \n\nHowever, we can use the fact that y represents the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell in the second scenario (49 customers receiving 6 less each). We know that if there were 49 customers, each would receive y/49 pastry goods. So: \n\n49(y/49-6) = x \n\nSimplifying: \n\ny-294 = x \n\nSo the confectioner needs to sell y-294 pastry goods. \n\nWe still don't know what y is, but we can use the fact that y represents the total amount of pastry goods the confectioner needs to sell in the second scenario (49 customers receiving 6 less each). We know that if there were 49 customers, each would receive y/49 pastry goods, and each would receive 6 less than if there were 35 customers. So: \n\n(y/35) - (y/49) = 6 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 35*49: \n\n49y - 35y = 6*35*49 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n14y = 10290 \n\ny = 735 \n\nSo the confectioner needs to sell 735-294 = 441 pastry goods. \n\nNone of the answer choices match exactly, but the closest one is B) 412.",

Let's assume that we need to add y liters of Liquid Q to make the ratio 3:4. \n\nThe initial ratio of Liquid P to Liquid Q is 3:2, which means that the initial amount of Liquid P is 3/5 of the total mixture and the initial amount of Liquid Q is 2/5 of the total mixture. \n\nSo, we have:\n\nInitial amount of Liquid P = (3/5) * 30 = 18 liters\nInitial amount of Liquid Q = (2/5) * 30 = 12 liters\n\nAfter adding y liters of Liquid Q, the total amount of Liquid Q becomes (12 + y) liters and the total amount of the mixture becomes (30 + y) liters. \n\nTo make the ratio 3:4, we need to have:\n\nLiquid P : Liquid Q = 3 : 4\n\nThis means that the ratio of Liquid P to the total mixture is 3/7 and the ratio of Liquid Q to the total mixture is 4/7. \n\nSo, we have:\n\nLiquid P = (3/7) * (30 + y) liters\nLiquid Q = (4/7) * (30 + y) liters\n\nWe want to find the value of y that makes the amount of Liquid Q equal to (12 + y) liters. \n\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\n\nLiquid Q = (4/7) * (30 + y) = 12 + y\n\nMultiplying both sides by 7, we get:\n\n4(30 + y) = 84 + 7y\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n120 + 4y = 84 + 7y\n\nSubtracting 4y from both sides, we get:\n\n120 = 84 + 3y\n\nSubtracting 84 from both sides, we get:\n\n36 = 3y\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\ny = 12\n\nTherefore, we need to add 12 liters of Liquid Q to make the ratio 3:4.

            "Response": "Let's assume that the initial amount of Liquid P and Liquid Q in the mixture is 3x and 2x, respectively. Therefore, the total initial volume of the mixture is 5x, which is equal to 30 liters. Solving for x, we get:\n\n5x = 30\nx = 6\n\nSo, the initial amount of Liquid P and Liquid Q in the mixture is 3x = 18 liters and 2x = 12 liters, respectively.\n\nTo make the ratio 3:4, we need to add more Liquid Q. Let's assume that we need to add y liters of Liquid Q. Therefore, the new total volume of the mixture will be 30 + y liters. The new ratio of Liquid P to Liquid Q will be:\n\nLiquid P : Liquid Q = 3x : (2x + y)\n\nWe want this ratio to be 3:4, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n3x : (2x + y) = 3 : 4\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n12x = 3(2x + y)\n12x = 6x + 3y\n6x = 3y\n2x = y\n\nSubstituting x = 6, we get:\n\ny = 2x = 2(6) = 12\n\nTherefore, we need to add 12 liters of Liquid Q to make the ratio 3:4.

Then we have:\n\nx = 2(555 - 445) * q + 60, where q is the quotient when x is divided by 555 + 445 = 1000.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 2(110)q + 60\nx = 220q + 60\n\nWe know that x leaves a remainder of 60 when divided by 1000. This means that x can be written as:\n\nx = 1000k + 60, where k is some integer.\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n1000k + 60 = 220q + 60\n1000k = 220q\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n125k = 11q\n\nSince k and q are both integers, this means that q must be a multiple of 125. Let q = 125m, where m is some integer. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n125k = 11(125m)\nk = 11m\n\nSo x can be written as:\n\nx = 1000k + 60\nx = 1000(11m) + 60\nx = 11000m + 60\n\nSince x is a 6-digit number, m must be between 1 and 9. Trying each value of m, we find that only m = 5 gives a 6-digit number. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nx = 11000m + 60 = 11000(5) + 60 = 55060\n\nSo the answer is (D) 456546.",

We can write this as:\n\nNew selling price = 1.05x\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for the new selling price:\n\n0.8x + $100 = 1.05x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.25x = $100\nx = $400\n\nTherefore, the cost price of the article was $400.

            "Response": "The volume of a cone is given by V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the radii of the cones are in the ratio of 1:2, let the radii be x and 2x. \n\nLet the heights of the cones be h1 and h2, respectively. Then we have:\n\nV1/V2 = (1/3)\u03c0(x^2)(h1)/(1/3)\u03c0(4x^2)(h2)\n1/10 = h1/h2 * 1/4\nh1/h2 = 2/5\n\nLet L be the length of the wire needed to form the two cones. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height of each cone:\n\nl1 = \u221a(h1^2 + x^2)\nl2 = \u221a(h2^2 + 4x^2)\n\nThe total length of wire used is the sum of the perimeters of the two circles (base of each cone) and the lengths of the two slant heights. Since the radii are in the ratio of 1:2, the circumference of the bases are in the ratio of 2\u03c0:4\u03c0 or 1:2. Therefore, we have:\n\nL = 2\u03c0x + 4\u03c0(2x) + l1 + l2\nL = 10\u03c0x + \u221a(h1^2 + x^2) + \u221a(h2^2 + 4x^2)\n\nSubstituting h1/h2 = 2/5, we get:\n\nL = 10\u03c0x + \u221a(4/25h2^2 + x^2) + \u221a(h2^2 + 4x^2)\nL = 10\u03c0x + (2/5)h2\u221a(1 + 4/25) + h2\u221a(1 + 4x^2/h2^2)\n\nSince we only need the ratio of the length of wire to x, we can assume without loss of generality that x = 1. Then we have:\n\nL/x = 10\u03c0 + (2/5)h2\u221a(1 + 4/25) + h2\u221a(1 + 4/h2^2)\nL/x = 10\u03c0 + (2/5)h2(3/5) + h2\u221a(h2^2 + 4)/h2\nL/x = 10\u03c0 + (6/25)h2 + \u221a(h2^2 + 4)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the last term by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\nL/x = 10\u03c0 + (6/25)h2 + (\u221a(h2^2 + 4) * (\u221a(h2^2 + 4) - h2))/((\u221a(h2^2 + 4) + h2))\nL/x = 10\u03c0 + (6/25)h2 + (4/(\u221a(h2^2 + 4) + h2))\n\nNow we can substitute h2 = 5 and simplify:\n\nL/x = 10\u03c0 + (6/25)(5) + (4/(\u221a(25 + 4) + 5))\nL/x = 10\u03c0 + 6/5 + 4/(\u221a29 + 5)\nL/x = (50\u03c0 + 32 + 4\u221a29)/(5(\u221a29 + 5))\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the length of wire to x is:\n\nL:x = (50\u03c0 + 32 + 4\u221a29)/(5(\u221a29 + 5)):1\n\nThe answer is (A) 2:5.",

Then we know that $Q$ is the median, so $\\frac{Q+r}{2}=10$. \n\nWe also know that the average capacity of the four barrels is 8 gallons, so $\\frac{p+Q+r+s}{4}=8$.

We also know that t1 + t2 = 2. \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 6 = 2x + 4t2, or t2 = (6 - 2x)/4. Substituting this value in t1 + t2 = 2, we get t1 = (2x - 2)/4 = (x - 1)/2. \n\nNow, using the formula Speed = Distance/Time, we can find the speed of the boat in still water as (6/(x + 4) + 6/(x - 4))/2. Substituting the values of t1 and t2, we get (3/(x + 4) + 3/(x - 4)) = 1. \n\nMultiplying both sides by (x + 4)(x - 4), we get the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0.

We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = rate x time\n\nSince the cars are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to get the relative speed at which they are approaching each other:\n\n46 mph + 54 mph = 100 mph\n\nUsing this relative speed, we can find the time it takes for them to cover the initial distance of 190 miles:\n\n190 miles = 100 mph x time\ntime = 1.9 hours\n\nSo they pass each other at 2:00 pm + 1.9 hours = 3:54 pm.\n\nNow we need to find out when they are moving away from each other and 35 miles apart. Since they are moving away from each other, we can subtract their speeds to get the relative speed at which they are separating:\n\n54 mph - 46 mph = 8 mph\n\nUsing this relative speed, we can find the time it takes for them to cover the distance of 35 miles:\n\n35 miles = 8 mph x time\ntime = 4.375 hours\n\nSo they are 35 miles apart at 3:54 pm + 4.375 hours = 8:14 pm.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the clock time, which is in the 12-hour format.

            "Response": "The deposit is 10% of $24 000, which is $2 400. So the amount to be paid off over 60 months is $24 000 - $2 400 = $21 600.\n\nTo calculate the monthly installment, we need to use the formula:\n\ninstallment = (principal + interest) / number of months\n\nwhere principal is the amount borrowed, interest is the total interest paid over the loan term, and number of months is the total number of months over which the loan is repaid.\n\nThe principal is $21 600, and the interest rate is 12% p.a. To calculate the total interest paid over the loan term, we need to multiply the principal by the interest rate and by the fraction of a year that the loan is repaid over. Since the loan is repaid over 60 months, which is 5 years, the fraction of a year is 1/5. So the total interest paid is:\n\n$21 600 x 12% x 1/5 = $1 296\n\nTherefore, the total amount to be repaid is:\n\n$21 600 + $1 296 = $22 896\n\nFinally, we can calculate the monthly installment:\n\ninstallment = $22 896 / 60 = $381.60\n\nTherefore, the answer is not among the options provided.",

            "Response": "The dealer is gaining 25% profit by using a false weight. Let's assume that the cost price of the goods is $100. \n\nIf the dealer uses the correct weight, he would sell the goods at $100 and make no profit. \n\nBut since he is using a false weight, he is able to sell the goods at a higher price and make a profit of 25%. \n\nLet's say the false weight is x% of the correct weight. \n\nSo, the dealer is selling x% of the correct weight at $125 (cost price + 25% profit). \n\nBut in reality, he should be selling 100% of the correct weight at $125. \n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation: \n\nx% of the correct weight * cost price = 100% of the correct weight * $125 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nx/100 * 100 = 125 \n\nx = 125 \n\nTherefore, the false weight is 125% of the correct weight. \n\nAnswer: D) 670 \n\nExplanation: We don't know the actual weight of the goods, so we can't calculate the false weight in terms of pounds or kilograms.

            "Response": "The correct answer is B) 40%.\n\nLet's assume that there are 100 passengers on the ship. According to the problem, 20% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and took their cars abroad the ship. This means that there are 20 passengers who fall under this category.\n\nNow, we know that 80% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship. So, out of the 20 passengers with round-trip tickets, only 20% took their cars abroad the ship, which is 4 passengers. This means that 16 passengers with round-trip tickets did not take their cars abroad the ship.\n\nTherefore, the total number of passengers with round-trip tickets is 20 (those who took their cars abroad) + 16 (those who did not take their cars abroad) = 36.\n\nSo, the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets is 36 out of 100, which is 36%. However, the question asks for the percentage of the ship's passengers who held round-trip tickets, not the percentage out of 100. Since we assumed that there are 100 passengers on the ship, the answer is 36% of 100, which is 36.

The prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5, and the prime factorization of 108 is 2^2 * 3^3.

Since the amount of sugar in the solution remains constant, we can set up the following equation:\n\n1.5 liters = (3/100) x (50-x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1.5 = (3/100) x 50 - (3/100) x x\n1.5 = 1.5 - (3/100) x^2\n(3/100) x^2 = 0\nx^2 = 0\nx = 0 or x = 100\n\nSince we need to evaporate some water to get a 3-percent solution, x cannot be 0.

During this time, the front of the train travels a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the platform. So, let's assume that the length of the platform is L, and the length of the train is T. Then, we can write:\nT + L = 15 x 36  (since the train takes 36 sec to pass the platform)\nT + L = 540\nSimilarly, during the time taken by the train to pass the man, only the length of the train is covered.

Then, we have:\n\nI1 = N1 * F1\nI2 = N2 * F2\nI3 = N3 * F3\n\nWe know that the total income from the train is 54,000. Therefore, we have:\n\nI1 + I2 + I3 = 54,000\n\nSubstituting the above expressions for I1, I2 and I3, we get:\n\nN1 * F1 + N2 * F2 + N3 * F3 = 54,000\n\nSubstituting the above expressions for N2/N1 and N3/N1, we get:\n\nN1 * F1 + 2x * F2/5 * N1 + 7x * F3/5 * N1 = 54,000\n\nSimplifying the above expression, we get:\n\nN1 * (F1 + 2x * F2/5 + 7x * F3/5) = 54,000\n\nSubstituting the given values for the ratios of the rates, we get:\n\nN1 * (5y + 2x * 4y/5 + 7x * 2y/5) = 54,000\n\nSimplifying the above expression, we get:\n\nN1 * (5y + 8xy/5 + 14xy/5) = 54,000\n\nN1 * (5y + 22xy/5) = 54,000\n\nN1 * (y + 4xy/5) = 10,800\n\nSubstituting the given value for the total income from the train, we get:\n\nN1 * (y + 4xy/5) = 10,800\n\nN1 * (5y/4) = 10,800\n\nN1 = 2,160\n\nTherefore, the number of passengers in A.C. sleeper class is 1x = N1 = 2,160.\n\nThe fare for A.C. sleeper class is 5y. Therefore, the income from A.C. sleeper class is:\n\nI1 = N1 * F1 = 2,160 * 5y = 10,800y\n\nSubstituting the given values for the ratios of the rates, we get:\n\nI1 = 2,160 * 5 * 4,000/25 = 2,160 * 800 = 1,728,000\n\nTherefore, the income of Indian Railways from A.C. sleeper class is 1,728,000, which is option (E) None of these.",

We can solve this quadratic inequality by finding the roots of the equation 15x^2 - x - 2 = 0 using the quadratic formula. The roots are x = (-(-1) \u00b1 sqrt((-1)^2 - 4(15)(-2))) / (2(15)) = (1 \u00b1 11) / 30 = -10/30 or 12/30 = -1/3 or 2/5. \n\nTo determine the range of values of x that satisfy the inequality, we can use test points. We can choose a value of x in each of the intervals (-\u221e, -1/3), (-1/3, 0), (0, 2/5), and (2/5, \u221e) and plug it into the inequality to see if it is true or false. \n\nFor x < -1/3, we can choose x = -1. Plugging this into the inequality, we get 15(-1)^2 - 2/-1 > 1, which simplifies to 15 + 2 > 1, which is true. Therefore, the interval (-\u221e, -1/3) satisfies the inequality. \n\nFor -1/3 < x < 0, we can choose x = -1/4. Plugging this into the inequality, we get 15(-1/4)^2 - 2/-1/4 > 1, which simplifies to 15/16 + 8 > 1, which is false. Therefore, the interval (-1/3, 0) does not satisfy the inequality. \n\nFor 0 < x < 2/5, we can choose x = 1/4. Plugging this into the inequality, we get 15(1/4)^2 - 2/1/4 > 1, which simplifies to 15/16 - 8 > 1, which is false. Therefore, the interval (0, 2/5) does not satisfy the inequality. \n\nFor x > 2/5, we can choose x = 1. Plugging this into the inequality, we get 15(1)^2 - 2/1 > 1, which simplifies to 15 - 2 > 1, which is true. Therefore, the interval (2/5, \u221e) satisfies the inequality. \n\nTherefore, the range of values of x that satisfy the inequality is -1/3 < x and x < 0, x > 2/5, which is option D.",
