            "Response": "1. Paige picked 53 flowers for the wedding.\n2. She was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one.\n3. To find out how many bouquets she could make, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet: 53 \u00f7 7 = 7.57\n4. Since we can't have a fraction of a bouquet, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Paige can make 7 bouquets.\n5. Unfortunately, 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding.\n6. To find out how many flowers she has left, we need to subtract the wilted flowers from the total: 53 - 18 = 35\n7.
