            "Response": "Explanation:\nTo find the product of 9 and 4, we can use the multiplication operation. We multiply the first digit of 9 with 4, which gives us 36. We write down the 6 and carry over the 3 to the next column. Then, we multiply the second digit of 9 with 4 and add the carried over 3, which gives us 39.

We write down the 2 in the ones place and carry over the 7 to the tens place. Then, we multiply 9 and 8's tens place, which gives us 72 again. We add the carried over 7 to get 79.
