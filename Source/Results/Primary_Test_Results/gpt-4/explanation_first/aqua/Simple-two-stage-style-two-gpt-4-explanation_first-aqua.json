This can be done in C(x,2) ways, where C(x,2) is the number of combinations of choosing 2 members from x members.

What is the current ratio Q of students per class?\nOptions:  A)Q=3 B)Q=4 C)6 D)8 E)12  Provide the explanation followed by the answer.. ",
            "Response": "Let Q be the current ratio of students per class, and let C be the number of classes. Then, the total number of students is Q * C = 120.\n\nIf the ratio of students per class were increased by 1, the new ratio would be (Q + 1), and the number of classes would be reduced by 10, so the new number of classes would be (C - 10). The total number of students would still be 120, so we can write the equation:\n\n(Q + 1) * (C - 10) = 120\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for the total number of students from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n(Q + 1) * (120 / Q - 10) = 120\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\n120 - 10Q + 120 / Q - 10 = 120\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n110 - 10Q + 120 / Q = 120\n\nSubtracting 110 from both sides, we get:\n\n-10Q + 120 / Q = 10\n\nMultiplying both sides by Q, we get:\n\n-10Q^2 + 120 = 10Q\n\nAdding 10Q^2 to both sides, we get:\n\n10Q^2 - 10Q + 120 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n\nQ^2 - Q + 12 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n(Q - 3)(Q - 4) = 0\n\nSo, the possible values for Q are 3 and 4.

When the bus is travelling at 60 kmph its consumption is 1 litre per hour. if each litre costs $60 and other expenses per hous is $ 60, then what would be the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 Km?\nOptions:  A)120 B)1250 C)1200 D)1100 E)1150  Provide the explanation followed by the answer.. ",
            "Response": "Let the consumption of diesel per hour be C litres and the speed of the bus be S kmph. According to the problem, C is directly proportional to the square of S, i.e., C \u221d S^2. \n\nWhen the bus is travelling at 60 kmph, its consumption is 1 litre per hour. So, we can write the proportionality equation as C = k * S^2, where k is the constant of proportionality. \n\nGiven, C = 1 litre per hour and S = 60 kmph. Substituting these values in the equation, we get 1 = k * (60)^2. Solving for k, we get k = 1 / (60)^2 = 1 / 3600.\n\nNow, let's find the consumption of diesel per hour when the bus is travelling at a speed of S kmph. We have C = (1 / 3600) * S^2.\n\nThe total cost of diesel for covering a distance of 600 km is given by the product of the consumption of diesel per hour and the cost per litre, i.e., C * 60. \n\nThe other expenses per hour are given as $60. So, the total expenditure per hour is given by (C * 60) + 60.\n\nTo minimize the expenditure, we need to minimize the time taken to cover the distance of 600 km. The time taken is given by the distance divided by the speed, i.e., 600 / S.\n\nSo, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is given by the product of the total expenditure per hour and the time taken, i.e., ((C * 60) + 60) * (600 / S).\n\nSubstituting the value of C from the proportionality equation, we get the minimum expenditure as ((1 / 3600) * S^2 * 60 + 60) * (600 / S).\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get the minimum expenditure as (S / 60) + 600.\n\nTo minimize the expenditure, we need to minimize the value of S / 60. The minimum value of S / 60 occurs when S = 60 kmph.\n\nSubstituting this value in the expression for the minimum expenditure, we get the minimum expenditure as (60 / 60) + 600 = 1 + 600 = 601.\n\nHowever, the given options do not have 601 as an option. The closest option to 601 is 600, which is option A. So, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is approximately $600.",

We need to find the probability that exactly 3 bulbs are good when 4 bulbs are chosen at random.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose 4 bulbs out of 9. This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)\n\nC(9, 4) = 9! / (4!(9-4)!) = 9! / (4!5!) = 126\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways to choose exactly 3 good bulbs and 1 defective bulb.

We can then subtract this from the total number of 5-digit integers to find the number of integers with an odd sum of digits.\n\nA 5-digit integer can be written as ABCDE, where A, B, C, D, and E are digits. Since A cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for A (1 through 9). There are 10 choices for each of B, C, D, and E (0 through 9).\n\nNow, let's consider the parity (even or odd) of each digit. If the sum of the digits is even, then there must be an even number of odd digits. There are three cases to consider:\n\n1) All digits are even: There is 1 choice for A (2, 4, 6, or 8), and 5 choices for each of B, C, D, and E (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). This gives a total of 1 * 5^4 = 625 integers.\n\n2) Two digits are odd: There are 4 choices for the two odd digits (B and C, B and D, B and E, or C and D). For each choice, there are 4 choices for the odd digits (1, 3, 5, or 7) and 5 choices for the even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). This gives a total of 4 * 4^2 * 5^3 = 16000 integers.\n\n3) Four digits are odd: There is 1 choice for the even digit (A). There are 4 choices for each odd digit (1, 3, 5, or 7) and 5 choices for the even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). This gives a total of 1 * 4^4 * 5 = 1280 integers.\n\nAdding these cases together, there are 625 + 16000 + 1280 = 17905 integers with an even sum of digits.\n\nThere are a total of 9 * 10^4 = 90000 5-digit integers. Subtracting the number of integers with an even sum of digits, we find that there are 90000 - 17905 = 72095 integers with an odd sum of digits.\n\nThe answer is 72095, which is closest to 9 * 10^3 = 9000.

            "Response": "The word 'ARMOUM' has 6 letters, including 2 M's and 2 U's.

So the formula becomes:\n\n6! / (2! * 2!)\n\n6! is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n2! is 2 * 1 = 2\n\nSo the number of different arrangements is:\n\n720 / (2 * 2) = 720 / 4 = 180\n\nHowever, the given options do not include 180. This could be an error in the options, or it could be that the question is asking for the number of arrangements where the two M's and the two U's are not together. In that case, we can find the number of arrangements where the M's and U's are together and subtract that from the total number of arrangements.\n\nTo find the number of arrangements where the M's are together, we can treat the two M's as a single unit. Then we have 5 elements: the MM unit, A, R, O, and U. There are 5! ways to arrange these elements, and within the MM unit, there are 2! ways to arrange the M's. So there are 5! * 2! ways to arrange the letters with the M's together.\n\nSimilarly, there are 5! * 2! ways to arrange the letters with the U's together.\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the arrangements where both the M's and U's are together. In this case, we have 4 elements: the MM unit, the UU unit, A, and R. There are 4! ways to arrange these elements, and within each unit, there are 2! ways to arrange the M's and U's. So there are 4! * 2! * 2! ways to arrange the letters with both the M's and U's together.\n\nSo the number of arrangements where the M's and U's are not together is:\n\nTotal arrangements - (M's together + U's together - both together)\n= 180 - (5! * 2! + 5! * 2! - 4! * 2! * 2!)\n= 180 - (240 + 240 - 96)\n= 180 - 384\n= -204\n\nSince this result is negative, it means that there are no arrangements where the M's and U's are not together.

Since all numbers are distinct, we can't repeat any digit in a single number.\n\nFirst, let's consider the number of ways to form a 6-digit number using these digits. We have 6 slots to fill, and since the number must be greater than 100,000, the first digit must be either 2, 3, or 4. \n\n1. If the first digit is 2, we have 2 options (2 or 4) for the second digit, 4 options for the third digit, 3 options for the fourth digit, 2 options for the fifth digit, and 1 option for the last digit.

Since the number must be greater than 100,000, the first digit must be either 2, 3, or 4.\n\n1. If the first digit is 2, we have 2 options (3 or 4) for the second digit, 4 options for the third digit, 3 options for the fourth digit, and 2 options for the last digit.

If the first digit is 3, we have 1 option (3) for the second digit, 3 options for the third digit, 2 options for the fourth digit, and 1 option for the last digit.

            "Query": "In a 4 person race, medals are awarded to the fastest 3 runners. The first-place runner receives a gold medal, the second-place runner receives a silver medal, and the third-place runner receives a bronze medal. In the event of a tie, the tied runners receive the same color medal. (For example, if there is a two-way tie for first-place, the top two runners receive gold medals, the next-fastest runner receives a silver medal, and no bronze medal is awarded). Assuming that exactly three medals are awarded, and that the three medal winners stand together with their medals to form a victory circle, how many Z different victory circles are possible?\nOptions:  A)24 B)52 C)96 D)144 E)648  Provide the explanation followed by the answer.. ",
            "Response": "There are 3 cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: Gold, Silver, and Bronze are all awarded (no ties)\nThere are 4 choices for the gold medalist, 3 choices for the silver medalist, and 2 choices for the bronze medalist. This gives us 4*3*2 = 24 different victory circles.\n\nCase 2: There is a tie for first place (two gold medals and one silver medal)\nThere are 4 ways to choose the two gold medalists (4 choose 2), and 2 choices for the silver medalist. This gives us 6*2 = 12 different victory circles.\n\nCase 3: There is a tie for second place (one gold medal and two silver medals)\nThere are 4 choices for the gold medalist, and 3 ways to choose the two silver medalists (3 choose 2). This gives us 4*3 = 12 different victory circles.\n\nAdding up the cases, we have 24 + 12 + 12 = 48 different victory circles. However, we have to consider that the order in which the medalists stand in the victory circle also matters. Since there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the 3 medalists, we multiply the number of victory circles by 6 to account for the different arrangements.\n\nSo, the total number of different victory circles is 48 * 6 = 288.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where there are two gold medalists and one silver medalist, as well as the cases where there is one gold medalist and two silver medalists. In these cases, there are only 3! / 2! = 3 ways to arrange the medalists, not 6. So, we need to subtract the overcounted arrangements.\n\nFor the case with two gold medalists and one silver medalist, we have overcounted 12 * (6 - 3) = 12 * 3 = 36 arrangements.\nFor the case with one gold medalist and two silver medalists, we have overcounted 12 * (6 - 3) = 12 * 3 = 36 arrangements.\n\nSubtracting the overcounted arrangements, we have 288 - 36 - 36 = 216 different victory circles.\n\nHowever, we have still overcounted the cases where all three medalists are tied (all gold medals). In this case, there is only 1 way to arrange the medalists, not 6. So, we need to subtract the overcounted arrangements for this case as well.\n\nThere are 4 ways to choose the three gold medalists (4 choose 3), and we have overcounted 4 * (6 - 1) = 4 * 5 = 20 arrangements.\n\nSubtracting the overcounted arrangements for this case, we have 216 - 20 = 196 different victory circles.\n\nSo, the answer is 196, which is not in the given options. However, if we consider the question to be asking for the number of different sets of medalists (ignoring the order in which they stand in the victory circle), then the answer would be 24 + 12 + 12 = 48, which is also not in the given options.",

This means we will find the number of selections that do not include any paperbacks and subtract that from the total number of possible selections.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible selections of 3 books from the shelf. We can use the combination formula for this:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of books (8) and k is the number of books we want to select (3).\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\nNow, let's find the number of selections that do not include any paperbacks.
