            "Response": "{25}\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nFirst, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\n1. There are no parentheses/brackets or exponents/orders in the expression, so we move on to multiplication and division.\n\n2. Perform the multiplication operations:\n   2 * 9 = 18\n   18 * 2 = 36\n\n3. Replace the multiplication operations in the expression with their results:\n   6 - 5 + 36 - 1 - 9\n\n4.
