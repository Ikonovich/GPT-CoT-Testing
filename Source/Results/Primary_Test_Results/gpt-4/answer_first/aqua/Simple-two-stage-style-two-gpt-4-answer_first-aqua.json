If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?\nOptions:  A)21 B)21.5 C)22 D)22.5 E)23  Provide the answer followed by the explanation.. ",
            "Response": "D)22.5\n\nLet x be the distance walked by Friend Q. Then, Friend P walks 1.15x. Since they start at opposite ends, the sum of the distances they walk is equal to the length of the trail, so x + 1.15x = 43. Combining the terms gives 2.15x = 43, and dividing both sides by 2.15 gives x = 20. Therefore, Friend P walks 1.15 * 20 = 23 km when they pass each other.",

            "Response": "A)$1600\n\nExplanation: \n\nSince the interest is compounded quarterly, we need to find the effective annual rate (EAR) to determine the annual interest payment. \n\nThe formula for EAR is: EAR = (1 + i/n)^(nt) - 1, where i is the nominal interest rate, n is the number of compounding periods per year, and t is the number of years.\n\nIn this case, i = 0.04, n = 4 (quarterly compounding), and t = 1 (annual interest payment).\n\nEAR = (1 + 0.04/4)^(4*1) - 1 = (1 + 0.01)^4 - 1 = 1.040604 - 1 = 0.040604 or 4.0604%\n\nNow, we can calculate the annual interest payment: $10,000 * 4.0604% = $406.04\n\nHowever, since Carl can only pay the interest, he will have to pay this amount every quarter. So, the approximate annual interest payment is $406.04 * 4 = $1624.16, which is closest to option A) $1600.",

",
            "Response": "B)27 seconds\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe speed of the man while rowing downstream is the sum of his speed in still water and the speed of the current, which is 25 kmph + 11 kmph = 36 kmph.\n\nTo convert this speed to meters per second, we can use the formula: 1 kmph = (1000/3600) m/s.\n\nSo, 36 kmph = 36 * (1000/3600) = 10 m/s.\n\nNow, we can use the formula time = distance/speed to find the time he takes to cover 80 meters.\n\nTime = 80 meters / 10 m/s = 8 seconds.",

            "Response": "B)9\n\nExplanation: If there are 6 possible combinations in which Jim and Ellen are not selected, then there must be k-2-2 = k-4 other members in the band. The number of ways to choose 2 members from k-4 members is given by the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen. In this case, n = k-4 and r = 2. So, we have:\n\nC(k-4, 2) = (k-4)! / (2!(k-6)!) = 6\n\nNow, we can simplify the factorials:\n\n(k-4)(k-5)/2 = 6\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n(k-4)(k-5) = 12\n\nExpanding the expression:\n\nk^2 - 9k + 20 = 12\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides:\n\nk^2 - 9k + 8 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n(k-1)(k-8) = 0\n\nThe possible values of k are 1 and 8.
