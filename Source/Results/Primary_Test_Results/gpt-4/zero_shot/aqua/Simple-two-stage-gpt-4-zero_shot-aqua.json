            "Response": "Let Q be the current ratio of students per class. Then the number of classes is 120/Q. If the ratio of students per class were increased by 1, the number of classes would be 120/(Q+1). According to the problem, 10 fewer classes would be run, so we can write the equation:\n\n120/Q - 120/(Q+1) = 10\n\nTo solve this equation, we can first eliminate the fractions by multiplying both sides by Q(Q+1):\n\n120(Q+1) - 120Q = 10Q(Q+1)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n120Q + 120 - 120Q = 10Q^2 + 10Q\n\n10Q^2 + 10Q - 120 = 0\n\nDividing by 10, we get:\n\nQ^2 + Q - 12 = 0\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n(Q+4)(Q-3) = 0\n\nThe possible values for Q are -4 and 3.

We are given that:\n\nF = 3(S1 + S2) (1)\n\nFour years from now, the father's age will be F + 4, and the sum of the ages of his sons will be (S1 + 4) + (S2 + 4) = S1 + S2 + 8. At that time, the father's age will be double the sum of the ages of his sons, so:\n\nF + 4 = 2(S1 + S2 + 8) (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with three variables. To solve for F, we can first solve equation (1) for S1 + S2:\n\nS1 + S2 = F/3 (3)\n\nNow substitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n\nF + 4 = 2(F/3 + 8)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3(F + 4) = 2(3)(F/3 + 8)\n\n3F + 12 = 6F + 48\n\nSubtracting 3F from both sides:\n\n12 = 3F + 48\n\nSubtracting 48 from both sides:\n\n-36 = 3F\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nF = -12\n\nSince the father's age cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices. However, if we assume that the father's age is actually three times the difference of the ages of his two sons (rather than the sum), we can find a valid solution:\n\nF = 3(S1 - S2) (1')\n\nNow substitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n\nF + 4 = 2(F/3 - 8)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n3(F + 4) = 2(3)(F/3 - 8)\n\n3F + 12 = 6F - 48\n\nSubtracting 3F from both sides:\n\n12 = 3F - 48\n\nAdding 48 to both sides:\n\n60 = 3F\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nF = 20\n\nSo if we assume that the father's age is three times the difference of the ages of his two sons, his present age is 20 years.

We want to find the probability of A \u2229 B, which is the event that a customer buys both a bagel and a coffee.\n\nWe can use the complementary probability to find this. The complementary event of A \u2229 B is A' \u222a B', which means that a customer does not buy a bagel or does not buy a coffee. Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events, we have:\n\nP(A' \u222a B') = P(A') + P(B') - P(A' \u2229 B')\n\nSince A' and B' are complementary events, we have P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 2/5 and P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 2/7. Now we need to find the probability of A' \u2229 B', which is the event that a customer does not buy a bagel and does not buy a coffee. Since the events are independent, we have:\n\nP(A' \u2229 B') = P(A') * P(B') = (2/5) * (2/7) = 4/35\n\nNow we can find the probability of A' \u222a B':\n\nP(A' \u222a B') = P(A') + P(B') - P(A' \u2229 B') = (2/5) + (2/7) - (4/35) = 14/35 + 10/35 - 4/35 = 20/35\n\nNow we can find the probability of A \u2229 B using the complementary probability:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = 1 - P(A' \u222a B') = 1 - 20/35 = 15/35\n\nNow we need to find the probability that at least 1 out of 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee. We can use the complementary probability again, which is the probability that none of the 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee. Since the events are independent, we have:\n\nP(None of the 8 customers buys both) = (1 - P(A \u2229 B))^8 = (1 - 15/35)^8 = (20/35)^8 = 2560000/783641640625\n\nNow we can find the probability that at least 1 out of 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee:\n\nP(At least 1 out of 8 customers buys both) = 1 - P(None of the 8 customers buys both) = 1 - 2560000/783641640625 = 783615640625/783641640625\n\nSo the probability that at least 1 customer bought a coffee and a bagel is approximately 199/245, which is option D.",

That's 5 possibilities.\n\nSection 3: There are 6 questions, and the candidate must attempt at least 1. So, the candidate can attempt 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 questions. That's 6 possibilities.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways the candidate can attempt the questions. Since the candidate's choices in each section are independent, we can simply multiply the number of possibilities in each section:\n\nTotal ways = 4 (Section 1) * 5 (Section 2) * 6 (Section 3) = 120\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the case where the candidate attempts only one question from each section, as this is not allowed:\n\nWays to attempt only one question from each section = 1 (Section 1) * 1 (Section 2) * 1 (Section 3) = 1\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nTotal ways - Ways to attempt only one question from each section = 120 - 1 = 119\n\nThe correct answer is C) 119.",

This can be done using the combination formula again:\n\nNumber of ways to form a committee with 5 men = C(7, 5) = 7! / (5! * 2!) = 21\n\nSo, the probability of having 0 women in the committee is the number of ways to form a committee with 5 men divided by the total number of ways to form a committee:\n\nProbability = 21 / 1287 = 7/429 \u2248 1/61\n\nHowever, this answer is not in the given options.

So there are 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 overcounted numbers.\n- Numbers with two 3's: There are 4 remaining digits to choose from for the second digit, 3 for the third, 2 for the fourth, and 1 for the fifth. So there are 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 overcounted numbers.\n- Numbers with two 4's: There are 4 remaining digits to choose from for the second digit, 3 for the third, 2 for the fourth, and 1 for the fifth. So there are 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 overcounted numbers.\n\nSo, the final answer is 720 - 24 - 24 - 24 = 648. However, this answer is not in the given options.

            "Response": "Let the amount of work done by 1 man in 1 day be M and the amount of work done by 1 woman in 1 day be W.\n\nAccording to the given information, the work done by 3 men and 4 women in 10 days is the same. So, we can write the equation:\n\n3M * 10 = 4W * 10\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n30M = 40W\n\nNow, we need to find the time taken by 5 men and 6 women to complete the work. Let the required time be T days.\n\nSo, the equation will be:\n\n(5M + 6W) * T = 1 (Since the whole work is considered as 1 unit)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of (5M + 6W) in terms of the given equation (30M = 40W).\n\nDividing the given equation by 10, we get:\n\n3M = 4W\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get:\n\n15M = 20W\n\nNow, adding 6W to both sides, we get:\n\n15M + 6W = 20W + 6W\n\nSo, (5M + 6W) = 2/3 (15M)\n\nNow, substituting this value in the equation (5M + 6W) * T = 1, we get:\n\n(2/3 * 15M) * T = 1\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nT = 3/5\n\nSo, the time taken by 5 men and 6 women to reap the field is 3/5 days.\n\nThe answer is C) 2/3.",

            "Response": "Let the amount of work done by 1 woman in 1 day be W and the amount of work done by 1 man in 1 day be M.\n\nAccording to the given information, 15 women can complete the project in 55 days. So, the total work done by 15 women in 55 days is 15W * 55.\n\nSimilarly, 10 men can complete the project in 55 days. So, the total work done by 10 men in 55 days is 10M * 55.\n\nSince both groups can complete the same project, we can equate the total work done by both groups:\n\n15W * 55 = 10M * 55\n\nDivide both sides by 55:\n\n15W = 10M\n\nNow, we need to find the time taken by 5 women and 4 men working together to complete the project. Let the number of days be x.\n\n5W * x + 4M * x = 15W * 55 (since the total work done by 5 women and 4 men should be equal to the total work done by 15 women)\n\nNow, substitute the value of 10M from the previous equation:\n\n5W * x + 4 * (15W/10) * x = 15W * 55\n\n5W * x + 6W * x = 15W * 55\n\nCombine the terms with x:\n\n11W * x = 15W * 55\n\nDivide both sides by 11W:\n\nx = (15W * 55) / 11W\n\nx = 15 * 5\n\nx = 75\n\nSo, 5 women and 4 men working together can complete the project in 75 days.\n\nThe answer is A) 75.",

So, the cistern is already (1/10 + 1/15) * 4 = (1/6) * 4 = 2/3 full.\n\nNow, the person closes the waste pipe, and in another 4 minutes, the cistern is full.

            "Response": "Let P be the number of spiders Pugsley has before trading, and W be the number of spiders Wednesday has before trading.\n\nIf Pugsley gives Wednesday 4 spiders, then P - 4 and W + 4 are their new amounts of spiders, respectively. According to the problem, Wednesday would then have four times as many spiders as Pugsley: W + 4 = 4(P - 4).\n\nIf Wednesday gives Pugsley 5 spiders, then P + 5 and W - 5 are their new amounts of spiders, respectively. According to the problem, Pugsley would now have five fewer spiders than Wednesday had before they traded: P + 5 = W - 5.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\nW + 4 = 4(P - 4)\nP + 5 = W - 5\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution. From the second equation, we can express W in terms of P: W = P + 10. Now we can substitute this expression for W in the first equation:\n\n(P + 10) + 4 = 4(P - 4)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nP + 14 = 4P - 16\n\nNow, solve for P:\n\n3P = 30\nP = 10\n\nSo, Pugsley has 10 pet spiders before the trading game commences.

So, the sum of the first 21 terms is:\n\nS_21 = 10 * (2^21 - 1) / (2 - 1)\nS_21 = 10 * (2097152 - 1)\nS_21 = 10 * 2097151\nS_21 = 20971510\n\nSo, after 21 hours, there are 20971510 liters of water in tank B.

            "Response": "Let Rahul's savings in National Savings Certificate be x and his savings in Public Provident Fund be y.\n\nAccording to the problem, (1/3)x = (1/2)y.\n\nWe also know that x + y = 1,50,000.\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find the value of x and y.\n\nFirst, we can express y in terms of x using the first equation: y = (2/3)x.\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for y in the second equation: x + (2/3)x = 1,50,000.\n\nCombining the terms with x, we get (5/3)x = 1,50,000.\n\nNow, we can solve for x: x = (3/5) * 1,50,000 = 90,000.\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y using the expression we found earlier: y = (2/3) * 90,000 = 60,000.\n\nSo, Rahul has saved Rs. 60,000 in Public Provident Fund.

            "Query": "A cargo ship carrying four kinds of items, doohickies, geegaws, widgets, and yamyams, arrives at the port. Each item weighs 2, 11, 5, and 7 pounds, respectively, and each item is weighed as it is unloaded. If, in the middle of the unloading process, the product of the individual weights of the unloaded items equals 104,350,400,000 pounds, how many widgets have been unloaded?\nOptions:  A)2 B)3 C)4 D)5 E)6  ",
            "Response": "First, we need to find the prime factorization of the given product of weights: $104,350,400,000 = 2^9 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 7^2$. Since each item weighs 2, 11, 5, or 7 pounds, we can see that the number of doohickies unloaded must be odd (since there are 9 factors of 2 in the product). \n\nLet's assume there are $x$ geegaws, $y$ widgets, and $z$ yamyams unloaded. Then, we have the following equations based on the weights and prime factorization:\n\n$2x + 11y + 7z = 9$ (since there are 9 factors of 2 in the product)\n$5y + 7z = 3$ (since there are 3 factors of 5 in the product)\n$11y + 7z = 2$ (since there are 2 factors of 11 in the product)\n\nNow, we can subtract the second equation from the third equation to get:\n\n$6y = -1 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nSince $y$ must be a whole number (as it represents the number of widgets unloaded), this is not possible. Therefore, there must be at least one doohickey unloaded. Let's assume there is 1 doohickey unloaded. Then, the equations become:\n\n$2x + 11y + 7z = 8$\n$5y + 7z = 3$\n$11y + 7z = 2$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation again, we get:\n\n$6y = -1 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nAgain, this is not possible. So, let's assume there are 3 doohickies unloaded. Then, the equations become:\n\n$2x + 11y + 7z = 7$\n$5y + 7z = 3$\n$11y + 7z = 2$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get:\n\n$6y = -1 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nOnce again, this is not possible. So, let's assume there are 5 doohickies unloaded. Then, the equations become:\n\n$2x + 11y + 7z = 6$\n$5y + 7z = 3$\n$11y + 7z = 2$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get:\n\n$6y = -1 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis is still not possible. So, let's assume there are 7 doohickies unloaded. Then, the equations become:\n\n$2x + 11y + 7z = 5$\n$5y + 7z = 3$\n$11y + 7z = 2$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get:\n\n$6y = -1 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis is still not possible. So, let's assume there are 9 doohickies unloaded. Then, the equations become:\n\n$2x + 11y + 7z = 4$\n$5y + 7z = 3$\n$11y + 7z = 2$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get:\n\n$6y = -1 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis is still not possible. However, we have exhausted all possibilities for the number of doohickies unloaded (since there cannot be more than 9 doohickies unloaded, as there are only 9 factors of 2 in the product). Therefore, we must have made an error in our assumption that the number of doohickies unloaded must be odd. \n\nGoing back to the original equations, let's assume there are 2 doohickies unloaded. Then, the equations become:\n\n$2x + 11y + 7z = 8$\n$5y + 7z = 3$\n$11y + 7z = 2$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get:\n\n$6y = -1 \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis is still not possible. So, let's assume there are 4 doohickies unloaded. Then, the equations become:\n\n$2x + 11y + 7z = 6$\n$5y + 7z = 3$\n$11y + 7",

Since the average capacity is 8 gallons, the total capacity is 4 * 8 = 32 gallons. Therefore, a + b + Q + d = 32.\n\nNow we want to maximize the capacity of the smallest barrel, Q. To do this, we need to minimize the capacities of the other barrels. Since a \u2264 b \u2264 Q \u2264 d, we can set a = b and d = Q. This gives us the equation a + a + Q + Q = 32, or 2a + 2Q = 32.\n\nNow we can use the equation b + Q = 20 to find the minimum value of a. If b = 10, then Q = 10 and a = 6. If b = 9, then Q = 11 and a = 5. If b = 8, then Q = 12 and a = 4. If b = 7, then Q = 13 and a = 3. If b = 6, then Q = 14 and a = 2.

            "Response": "Since the cars are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to find the relative speed at which they are approaching each other. Car P is moving at 46 mph and Car Q is moving at 54 mph, so their combined speed is 46 + 54 = 100 mph.\n\nAt 2:00 pm, they are 190 miles apart. They will pass each other when the distance between them becomes 0. To find the time it takes for this to happen, we can use the formula:\n\ntime = distance / speed\n\nIn this case, the distance is 190 miles and the speed is 100 mph, so the time it takes for them to pass each other is:\n\ntime = 190 / 100 = 1.9 hours\n\nNow we need to find the time it takes for them to be 35 miles apart after passing each other. Since they are now moving away from each other, we can still use their combined speed of 100 mph. The distance they need to cover is 35 miles, so the time it takes for this to happen is:\n\ntime = 35 / 100 = 0.35 hours\n\nNow we can add the time it takes for them to pass each other and the time it takes for them to be 35 miles apart:\n\ntotal time = 1.9 hours + 0.35 hours = 2.25 hours\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the decimal part of the total time to minutes:\n\n0.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 15 minutes\n\nSo the total time is 2 hours and 15 minutes. If we add this to the starting time of 2:00 pm, we get:\n\n2:00 pm + 2 hours + 15 minutes = 4:15 pm\n\nSo the correct answer is D) 4:15 pm.",

            "Response": "We can use the concept of stars and bars to solve this problem. We have 3 prizes (stars) and we want to distribute them among 4 boys (bars). We can represent this as a sequence of stars and bars, where the number of stars between the bars represents the number of prizes each boy gets.\n\nFor example, if we have the sequence *|**|*|, this means the first boy gets 1 prize, the second boy gets 2 prizes, and the third and fourth boys get 0 prizes.\n\nWe can think of this as placing 3 stars and 3 bars in a row. There are a total of 6 positions, and we need to choose 3 of them to place the stars. The remaining positions will be filled with bars.\n\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of positions and k is the number of positions we need to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and k = 3, so the number of ways to distribute the prizes is:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6*5*4) / (3*2*1) = 20*5 = 100\n\nHowever, this includes the case where all 3 prizes go to one boy, which is not allowed. There are 4 ways for this to happen (one for each boy), so we need to subtract these cases from our total.\n\nSo the final answer is 100 - 4 = 96 ways to distribute the prizes.",

            "Response": "Let the amount of coal required for 8 engines, each running 13 hours a day, be x metric tonnes.\n\nAccording to the given information, 3 engines of the former type consume as much as 4 engines of the latter type. So, we can write the proportion:\n\n9 engines (former type) / 8 engines (latter type) = 3 engines (former type) / 4 engines (latter type)\n\n9/8 = 3/4\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n9 * 4 = 8 * 3\n\n36 = 24\n\nNow, we know that 9 engines of the former type consume 24 metric tonnes of coal when each is working 8 hours a day. So, we can write the equation:\n\n9 engines * 8 hours/day * 24 metric tonnes = 8 engines * 13 hours/day * x metric tonnes\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n9 * 8 * 24 = 8 * 13 * x\n\n72 * 24 = 104 * x\n\n1728 = 104x\n\nx = 1728 / 104\n\nx = 16.6153846\n\nSince the amount of coal required should be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 17 metric tonnes.\n\nSo, the amount of coal required for 8 engines, each running 13 hours a day, is approximately 17 metric tonnes.

Then, we have:\n\nx/vB = 1000/vC (3)\n\nWe can solve equations (1) and (2) for vB and vC, respectively:\n\nvB = 1000vA/900 (4)\nvC = 1000vA/800 (5)\n\nNow, substitute equations (4) and (5) into equation (3):\n\nx/(1000vA/900) = 1000/(1000vA/800)\n\nSimplify and solve for x:\n\nx = (1000vA/900) * (800/1000vA)\nx = (800/900) * 1000\nx = (8/9) * 1000\nx = 888.89 meters\n\nSo, B can give C a start of 1000 - 888.89 = 111.11 meters. The closest option to this value is 111.12 meters (Option A).",

To find the number of monster books he has, we can set up a proportion:\n\n4/5 = x/20\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n5x = 4 * 20\n5x = 80\nx = 16\n\nSo Yukou has 16 monster books.\n\nHe wants to read a book every week for a year, which means he needs 52 books in total. He currently has 16 monster books + 20 space travel books = 36 books.\n\nHe needs to buy 52 - 36 = <<52-36=16>>16 more books.\n\nTo maintain the 4:5 ratio, we can set up another proportion:\n\n4/5 = y/(16+y)\n\nTo solve for y, we can cross-multiply:\n\n5y = 4 * (16+y)\n5y = 64 + 4y\ny = 64\n\nSo Yukou needs to buy 8 more monster books.\n\nNow we can find the number of space travel books he needs to buy:\n\n20 + y = 52\ny = 52 - 20\ny = 32\n\nSo Yukou needs to buy 10 more space travel books.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) 8 monster, 10 space.",

We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set.

            "Response": "We can solve this problem using combinatorics. First, let's consider the number of ways to distribute the 5 cards among the 3 envelopes. We can think of this as placing 2 dividers among the 5 cards, which can be done in C(6,2) = 15 ways. For example, if we have cards A, B, C, D, and E, one possible distribution is A|BC|DE, where the dividers separate the cards into the 3 envelopes.\n\nNow, we need to consider the number of distinct sets of envelope numbers that can be produced. Since the cards have prime numbers on them, the product of the cards in each envelope will also be distinct. Therefore, we just need to count the number of ways to order the 3 envelope numbers.\n\nFor each of the 15 ways to distribute the cards, there are 3! = 6 ways to order the envelope numbers. However, we need to divide by 3! to account for overcounting, since the order of the envelopes doesn't matter (e.g., the set {A, BC, DE} is the same as {BC, A, DE}). Therefore, there are 15 * 6 / 3! = 15 different sets of envelope numbers that can be produced.\n\nSo the answer is A) 41.",

            "Response": "To get a 3-percent sugar solution without evaporating any water, the amount of sugar in the solution must remain the same. We can find the amount of sugar in the 50 liters of 3-percent sugar solution by multiplying the volume by the percentage of sugar:\n\n50 liters * 0.03 = 1.5 liters of sugar\n\nNow, let's assume we evaporate x liters of water from the solution. The new volume of the solution will be 50 - x liters. We want the percentage of sugar in this new solution to be 3 percent as well. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n1.5 liters of sugar / (50 - x) liters = 0.03\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n1.5 = 0.03 * (50 - x)\n1.5 = 1.5 - 0.03x\n0.03x = 0\n\nSince 0.03x = 0, this means that x = 0.

            "Response": "The car can travel 60 miles per hour * 20 minutes = <<60*20=1200>>1200 miles on a gallon of gasoline.\nSo, the car can travel 1200 miles / 60 miles per hour = <<1200/60=20>>20 hours on a gallon of gasoline.\nThus, the car can travel 20 hours * 60 minutes = <<20*60=1200>>1200 minutes on a gallon of gasoline.\nTherefore, the car can travel 1200 minutes / 20 minutes = <<1200/20=60>>60 miles on a gallon of gasoline.\nTo travel 80 miles at 60 mph, the car used 80 miles / 60 miles = <<80/60=1.3333333333333333>>1.3333333333333333 gallons of gasoline.\nSince the car had 8 gallons of gasoline left in its tank at the end, it started with 8 gallons + 1.3333333333333333 gallons = <<8+1.3333333333333333=9.333333333333333>>9.333333333333333 gallons of gasoline.\nThus, the car used 1.3333333333333333 gallons / 9.333333333333333 gallons = 0.14285714285714285 or 14.285714285714285% of the tank to travel 80 miles at 60 mph.\nSince 14.285714285714285% is not among the options, we can round it off to the nearest option, which is 15% (Option B).

            "Response": "To solve the inequality 15x - 2/x > 1, we first need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the inequality by x:\n\n15x^2 - 2 > x\n\nNow, we want to get everything on one side of the inequality, so we'll subtract x from both sides:\n\n15x^2 - x - 2 > 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic inequality. To solve this, we'll first find the roots of the quadratic equation 15x^2 - x - 2 = 0. We can do this by factoring or using the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is a bit tricky, so we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 15, b = -1, and c = -2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 \u00b1 \u221a((-1)^2 - 4(15)(-2))) / (2(15))\nx = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 120)) / 30\nx = (1 \u00b1 \u221a121) / 30\nx = (1 \u00b1 11) / 30\n\nThis gives us two roots: x = -1/3 and x = 2/5.\n\nNow, we'll test the intervals between these roots to see where the inequality is true. We'll test x < -1/3, -1/3 < x < 2/5, and x > 2/5.\n\n1. For x < -1/3, we can test x = -1. Plugging this into the inequality, we get:\n\n15(-1)^2 - 2/(-1) > 1\n15 - 2 > 1\n13 > 1\n\nThis is true, so the inequality holds for x < -1/3.\n\n2. For -1/3 < x < 2/5, we can test x = 0. Plugging this into the inequality, we get:\n\n15(0)^2 - 2/0 > 1\n\nThis is undefined, so the inequality does not hold for -1/3 < x < 2/5.\n\n3. For x > 2/5, we can test x = 1. Plugging this into the inequality, we get:\n\n15(1)^2 - 2/1 > 1\n15 - 2 > 1\n13 > 1\n\nThis is true, so the inequality holds for x > 2/5.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the inequality is x < -1/3 and x > 2/5, which corresponds to option E.",

Therefore, M = 1/15.\n\nTogether, the man and his son can do the work in 6 days, so in 1 day, they do 1/6 of the work. Therefore, M + S = 1/6.\n\nNow we can set up an equation to solve for S:\n\n1/15 + S = 1/6\n\nTo solve for S, first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 30.

There are 13 letters in the word, but some of them are repeated. There are 2 M's, 3 E's, 2 R's, 2 A's, and 2 N's. So, the total number of arrangements is:\n\n13! / (2! * 3! * 2! * 2! * 2!) = 6,227,020 / (2 * 6 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 1,038,670\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable arrangements, i.e., those with E as the first letter and R as the last letter. We are left with 11 letters to arrange, with 2 M's, 2 E's, 1 R, 2 A's, and 2 N's. The number of favorable arrangements is:\n\n11! / (2! * 2! * 1! * 2! * 2!) = 39,916,800 / (2 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 2) = 4,990,840\n\nFinally, let's find the probability Q:\n\nQ = (Number of favorable arrangements) / (Total number of arrangements)\nQ = 4,990,840 / 1,038,670 \u2248 1/20\n\nSo, the probability Q is approximately 1/20, which corresponds to option B.",
