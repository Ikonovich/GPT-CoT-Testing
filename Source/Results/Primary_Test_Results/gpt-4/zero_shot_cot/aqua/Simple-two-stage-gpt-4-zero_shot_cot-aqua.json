Then, the distance walked by Friend P is 1.15x (since P's rate is 15% faster than Q's).\n\nSince they are walking towards each other, the sum of the distances they walk is equal to the total length of the trail, which is 43 km. So, we can write the equation:\n\nx + 1.15x = 43\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n2.15x = 43\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 43 / 2.15\nx = 20\n\nNow that we know the distance walked by Friend Q, we can find the distance walked by Friend P:\n\n1.15x = 1.15 * 20\n1.15x = 23\n\nSo, Friend P will have walked 23 kilometers when they pass each other.

So, the total number of ways to select 2 members from the k-2 members is C(k-2, 2) = (k-2)! / (2!(k-4)!).\n\nNow, we know that there are 6 possible combinations in which Jim and Ellen are not selected.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the rate of interest at which Rs. 825 becomes Rs. 956 in 3 years.\n\nWe know that Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100\n\nIn this case, Principal = Rs. 825, Time = 3 years, and SI = Rs. (956 - 825) = Rs. 131\n\nSo, we can write the equation as:\n\n131 = (825 * Rate * 3) / 100\n\nNow, we need to find the Rate. Let's solve for Rate:\n\nRate = (131 * 100) / (825 * 3)\nRate = 13100 / 2475\nRate = 5.3 %\n\nNow, we are given that the rate of interest is increased by 4%. So, the new rate of interest is (5.3 + 4) = 9.3 %\n\nWe need to find the amount that Rs. 825 will become in 3 years at this new rate of interest.\n\nWe can use the formula for Simple Interest again:\n\nSI = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100\n\nIn this case, Principal = Rs. 825, Time = 3 years, and Rate = 9.3 %\n\nSI = (825 * 9.3 * 3) / 100\nSI = 229.725\n\nNow, we need to find the final amount. The final amount is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:\n\nAmount = Principal + SI\nAmount = 825 + 229.725\nAmount = Rs. 1054.725\n\nSince the options are in whole numbers, we can round the amount to the nearest whole number, which is Rs. 1055.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) Rs. 1055.",

            "Response": "Since square P is inscribed in circle Q, the diameter of circle Q is equal to the diagonal of square P.\n\nLet the side length of square P be s. Then the perimeter of P is 4s, so we have 4s = 40, which means s = 10.\n\nNow we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal of square P. If we draw a diagonal, it splits the square into two 45-45-90 triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are congruent and the hypotenuse is \u221a2 times the length of a leg. So the diagonal of square P, which is also the diameter of circle Q, is 10\u221a2.\n\nFinally, we can find the circumference of circle Q using the formula C = \u03c0d, where C is the circumference and d is the diameter.

            "Response": "First, let's find the total number of ways to seat the 3 persons in the 5 chairs. This can be done in 5P3 ways, which is 5!/(5-3)! = 5*4*3 = 60 ways.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways the couple can sit together. We can treat the couple as a single entity, so we have 4 entities to place in 5 chairs (the couple and the single person). This can be done in 5P4 ways, which is 5!/(5-4)! = 5*4*3*2 = 120 ways. However, since the couple can switch places, we have overcounted the number of ways they can sit together. There are 2! ways for the couple to switch places, so we need to divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting. So, there are 120/2 = 60 ways for the couple to sit together.\n\nNow, we can find the number of ways the couple does not sit together by subtracting the number of ways they sit together from the total number of ways: 60 - 60 = 0 ways. This means that the probability that the couple does not sit together is 0/60 = 0.\n\nHowever, this answer does not match any of the given options. There must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe made a mistake in calculating the number of ways the couple can sit together. Instead of treating the couple as a single entity, we should have treated them as two separate entities. So, we have 3 entities to place in 5 chairs (the couple and the single person). This can be done in 5P3 ways, which is 5!/(5-3)! = 5*4*3 = 60 ways. However, since the couple can switch places, we have overcounted the number of ways they can sit together. There are 2! ways for the couple to switch places, so we need to divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting. So, there are 60/2 = 30 ways for the couple to sit together.\n\nNow, we can find the number of ways the couple does not sit together by subtracting the number of ways they sit together from the total number of ways: 60 - 30 = 30 ways. This means that the probability that the couple does not sit together is 30/60 = 1/2.\n\nHowever, this answer still does not match any of the given options. Let's try a different approach.\n\nInstead of finding the total number of ways to seat the 3 persons in the 5 chairs, let's find the number of ways to seat the couple together and the single person separately. We can treat the couple as a single entity, so we have 2 entities to place in 5 chairs (the couple and the single person). This can be done in 5P2 ways, which is 5!/(5-2)! = 5*4 = 20 ways. Since the couple can switch places, there are 2! ways for the couple to switch places, so there are 20*2 = 40 ways for the couple to sit together.\n\nNow, we can find the number of ways the couple does not sit together by subtracting the number of ways they sit together from the total number of ways: 60 - 40 = 20 ways. This means that the probability that the couple does not sit together is 20/60 = 1/3.\n\nHowever, this answer still does not match any of the given options.

Then, we have:\n\nx + 1 = 630k (where k is an integer)\n\nx = 630k - 1\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest number, let's start with the smallest possible value of k, which is 1:\n\nx = 630 \u00d7 1 - 1 = 629\n\nSo, the smallest number when increased by 1 is exactly divisible by 6, 9, 15, 35, and 45 is 629.

We need to find the length of the other diagonal (d2).\n\nStep 3: Recall the properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. This means that each half of a diagonal is the leg of a right triangle, with the side of the rhombus as the hypotenuse.\n\nStep 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of half of the other diagonal. Let x be half of the other diagonal (d2/2). Then, we have the equation (25^2) = (30/2)^2 + x^2.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x. (25^2) = (15^2) + x^2 => x^2 = 625 - 225 => x^2 = 400 => x = 20 cm.\n\nStep 6: Since x is half of the other diagonal, the length of the other diagonal (d2) is 2 * 20 = 40 cm.\n\nStep 7: Use the formula for the area of a rhombus to find the area.

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the constant of variation\nWe know that the consumption of diesel per hour (C) varies directly as the square of its speed (S). So, we can write the equation as C = kS^2, where k is the constant of variation.\n\nWhen the bus is traveling at 60 kmph, its consumption is 1 litre per hour. So, we can plug these values into the equation to find k:\n1 = k(60)^2\n1 = k(3600)\nk = 1/3600\n\nStep 2: Find the consumption of diesel per hour at different speeds\nWe can use the equation C = kS^2 to find the consumption of diesel per hour at different speeds. For example, if the bus is traveling at 30 kmph, its consumption would be:\nC = (1/3600)(30)^2\nC = (1/3600)(900)\nC = 1/4 litres per hour\n\nStep 3: Find the total cost of diesel for the trip\nTo find the total cost of diesel for the trip, we need to find the total consumption of diesel and multiply it by the cost per litre. Since the bus needs to cover a distance of 600 km, we can find the total consumption of diesel by multiplying the consumption per hour by the number of hours it takes to cover the distance.\n\nLet's assume the bus travels at a constant speed of 30 kmph. In this case, it would take 600/30 = 20 hours to cover the distance. The total consumption of diesel would be 20 * (1/4) = 5 litres. The total cost of diesel would be 5 * $60 = $300.\n\nStep 4: Find the total cost of other expenses\nSince the other expenses per hour are $60, the total cost of other expenses for the trip would be 20 * $60 = $1200.\n\nStep 5: Find the minimum expenditure required to cover the distance\nThe minimum expenditure required to cover the distance would be the sum of the total cost of diesel and the total cost of other expenses. In this case, it would be $300 + $1200 = $1500.\n\nHowever, this is not the minimum expenditure possible, as the bus can travel at different speeds. To find the minimum expenditure, we need to find the speed at which the total cost is minimized.\n\nStep 6: Find the speed that minimizes the total cost\nTo find the speed that minimizes the total cost, we can differentiate the total cost function with respect to speed and set it equal to zero. The total cost function can be written as:\nTotal cost = (kS^2 * distance/S) * cost per litre + other expenses per hour * (distance/S)\n\nDifferentiating this function with respect to speed and setting it equal to zero, we get:\n0 = (2kS * distance - other expenses per hour * distance) / S^3\n\nSolving for S, we get:\nS = sqrt(other expenses per hour / (2k * distance))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nS = sqrt(60 / (2 * (1/3600) * 600))\nS = sqrt(60 / (1/3))\nS = sqrt(180)\nS = 60/3 = 20 kmph\n\nStep 7: Find the minimum expenditure at the optimal speed\nAt the optimal speed of 20 kmph, the total cost of diesel and other expenses can be calculated as before. The total consumption of diesel would be (1/3600)(20)^2 * (600/20) = 2 litres. The total cost of diesel would be 2 * $60 = $120.\n\nThe total cost of other expenses would be (600/20) * $60 = $1800.\n\nThe minimum expenditure required to cover the distance would be $120 + $1800 = $1920.\n\nHowever, this value is not in the given options.

Since train B takes 4 hours to reach its destination after meeting train A, it must have taken 't' hours to reach the meeting point as well.\n\nStep 3: Find the distance covered by train B to reach the meeting point.\n\nSince train A and train B are traveling in opposite directions, the distance covered by train A to reach the meeting point is the same as the distance covered by train B to reach the meeting point.\n\nSo, the distance covered by train B to reach the meeting point is also 540 km.\n\nStep 4: Find the speed of train B.\n\nNow, we can find the speed of train B using the formula:\n\nSpeed = Distance \u00f7 Time\nSpeed = 540 km \u00f7 t hours\n\nStep 5: Use the given information to find the value of 't'.\n\nWe know that train A takes 9 hours to reach its destination after meeting train B, and train B takes 4 hours to reach its destination after meeting train A. So, the total time taken by both trains to reach their destinations is 9 + 4 = 13 hours.\n\nSince both trains meet after 't' hours, the remaining time for train A to reach its destination is 9 - t hours, and the remaining time for train B to reach its destination is 4 - t hours.\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal time taken by both trains = Time taken by train A + Time taken by train B\n13 hours = (9 - t) + (4 - t)\n\nStep 6: Solve for 't'.\n\n13 hours = 13 - 2t\n2t = 0\nt = 0\n\nSince 't' cannot be zero, there must be an error in the given information. The correct information should be that train A takes 9 hours to reach its destination after meeting train B, and train B takes 4 hours to reach its destination after meeting train A. So, the total time taken by both trains to reach their destinations is 9 + 4 = 13 hours.\n\nNow, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal time taken by both trains = Time taken by train A + Time taken by train B\n13 hours = 9 hours + 4 hours\n13 hours = 13 hours\n\nSince the total time taken by both trains is equal to the sum of the time taken by each train, we can conclude that the speed of train B is:\n\nSpeed = 540 km \u00f7 4 hours\nSpeed = 135 kmph\n\nSo, the rate at which train B runs is 135 kmph.

First, let's eliminate y by multiplying the first equation by (1/3) and subtracting it from the second equation:\n\n(5/9)x + (2/3)y - (1/3)(x + y) = (4/9)x + (1/3)y - (1/3)(x + y)\n\n(5/9)x - (1/3)x = (4/9)x - (1/3)x\n\n(2/9)x = (1/9)x\n\nx = 15\n\nNow, let's find y by substituting x back into the first equation:\n\n15 + y = 30\n\ny = 15\n\nSo, the volume that should be taken out from the first jar is 15 liters.

            "Response": "First, let's consider the possible values for the sum of the digits. Since there are 5 digits and each digit can be at most 9, the maximum sum is 5 * 9 = 45. The minimum sum is 5 * 1 = 5, since the first digit cannot be 0. So, the possible values for the odd sum E are 5, 7, 9, ..., 45.\n\nNow, let's consider how many ways we can distribute the sum among the 5 digits. For example, if the sum is 5, we can have the following combinations: 50001, 41001, 32001, 31101, 22101, 21111. Notice that we can have at most 4 odd digits, since the sum of 5 odd digits would be odd.\n\nLet's use the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to distribute the sum among the 5 digits. We have E - 1 bars and 4 stars (since the first digit cannot be 0). The number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is C(E - 1 + 4, 4) = C(E + 3, 4).\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where there are 5 odd digits. In this case, we have E - 5 bars and 5 stars. The number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is C(E - 5 + 5, 5) = C(E, 5).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to distribute the sum among the 5 digits is C(E + 3, 4) - C(E, 5). We need to sum this expression for all odd values of E from 5 to 45.\n\nThe sum is: (C(8, 4) - C(5, 5)) + (C(10, 4) - C(7, 5)) + ... + (C(48, 4) - C(45, 5)).\n\nNow, we can use the identity C(n, k) = C(n, n - k) to simplify the expression:\n\nThe sum is: (C(8, 4) - C(5, 0)) + (C(10, 4) - C(7, 2)) + ... + (C(48, 4) - C(45, 40)).\n\nNow, we can use the identity C(n - 1, k - 1) = C(n, k) - C(n - 1, k) to rewrite the sum as a telescoping series:\n\nThe sum is: C(8, 4) - C(7, 3) + C(10, 4) - C(9, 3) + ... + C(48, 4) - C(47, 3).\n\nNotice that most of the terms cancel out, leaving us with:\n\nThe sum is: C(48, 4) - C(7, 3).\n\nNow, we can compute the values:\n\nThe sum is: 43758 - 35 = 43723.\n\nSo, there are 43723 positive 5-digit integers with an odd sum of their digits.

            "Response": "First, let's consider the maximum number of intersection points created by adding one circle at a time.\n\n1. When we have only 1 circle, there are 0 intersection points.\n2. When we add a second circle, it can intersect the first circle at a maximum of 2 points.\n3. When we add a third circle, it can intersect each of the previous 2 circles at a maximum of 2 points each, creating 2 + 2 = 4 new intersection points.\n4. When we add a fourth circle, it can intersect each of the previous 3 circles at a maximum of 2 points each, creating 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 new intersection points.\n\nWe can see a pattern here. Each time we add a new circle, it can intersect each of the previous circles at a maximum of 2 points, so the number of new intersection points created is 2 times the number of previous circles.\n\nNow let's calculate the total number of intersection points for 15 circles:\n\n1. 0 (first circle)\n2. 2 (second circle)\n3. 4 (third circle)\n4. 6 (fourth circle)\n...\n15. 28 (fifteenth circle)\n\nTo find the total number of intersection points, we can sum up these numbers:\n\n0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 28\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with 15 terms, a first term of 0, and a common difference of 2. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nSum = (15 * (0 + 28)) / 2 = (15 * 28) / 2 = 210\n\nSo the greatest possible number of intersection points for 15 circles is 210.

How many different routes can she take starting from A and returning to A, going through both B and C (but not more than once through each) and not travelling any road twice on the same trip?\nOptions:  A)10 B)8 C)6 D)4 E)2  Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, let's consider the number of ways Amy can travel from A to B or C. There are 2 roads connecting A to B and 3 roads connecting A to C. So, she has 2 + 3 = 5 choices for her first destination.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of ways she can travel from B to C or C to B. If she is at B, there is only 1 road connecting B to C. If she is at C, there are 2 roads connecting C to B. So, she has 1 + 2 = 3 choices for her second destination.\n\nFinally, let's consider the number of ways she can travel back to A. If she is at B, there are 1 remaining road connecting B to A. If she is at C, there are 2 remaining roads connecting C to A. So, she has 1 + 2 = 3 choices for her final destination.\n\nTo find the total number of different routes, we multiply the number of choices for each step: 5 * 3 * 3 = 45. However, we have counted each route twice (once for going from A to B to C to A and once for going from A to C to B to A), so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual number of different routes: 45 / 2 = 22.5. Since the number of routes must be an integer, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem. We know that Amy has 5 choices for her first destination. However, we cannot simply multiply the number of choices for each step, as we did before, because the number of choices for the second and third steps depends on the first step. Instead, let's consider each possible first destination separately:\n\n1. If Amy goes from A to B using the upper road, she has 1 choice for her second destination (B to C) and 2 choices for her final destination (C to A using either the middle or lower road). This gives a total of 1 * 2 = 2 routes.\n\n2. If Amy goes from A to B using the lower road, she again has 1 choice for her second destination (B to C) and 2 choices for her final destination (C to A using either the middle or lower road). This gives a total of 1 * 2 = 2 routes.\n\n3. If Amy goes from A to C using the upper road, she has 2 choices for her second destination (C to B using either the upper or lower road) and 1 choice for her final destination (B to A using the remaining road). This gives a total of 2 * 1 = 2 routes.\n\n4. If Amy goes from A to C using the middle road, she again has 2 choices for her second destination (C to B using either the upper or lower road) and 1 choice for her final destination (B to A using the remaining road). This gives a total of 2 * 1 = 2 routes.\n\n5. If Amy goes from A to C using the lower road, she has only 1 choice for her second destination (C to B using the upper road) and 1 choice for her final destination (B to A using the remaining road). This gives a total of 1 * 1 = 1 route.\n\nAdding up the number of routes for each possible first destination, we get 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 different routes. However, this is not one of the given options. Let's check our calculations again.\n\nWe made a mistake in the first two cases. If Amy goes from A to B using the upper road, she has 1 choice for her second destination (B to C) and 1 choice for her final destination (C to A using the lower road). This gives a total of 1 * 1 = 1 route. Similarly, if Amy goes from A to B using the lower road, she has 1 choice for her second destination (B to C) and 1 choice for her final destination (C to A using the upper road). This gives a total of 1 * 1 = 1 route.\n\nNow, adding up the number of routes for each possible first destination, we get 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 different routes. However, this is still not one of the given options. Let's check our calculations one more time.\n\nWe made another mistake in the last case. If Amy goes from A to C using the lower road, she has only 1 choice for her second destination (C to B using the lower road) and 1 choice for her final destination (B to A using the remaining road). This gives a total of 1 * 1 = 1 route.\n\nNow, adding up the number of routes for each possible first destination, we get 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 different routes.

            "Response": "First, we need to find the relative speed between the train and the man. Since they are moving in the same direction, we will subtract the man's speed from the train's speed.\n\nLet the speed of the train be x km/hr. Then, the relative speed is (x - 1) km/hr.\n\nNow, we need to convert the relative speed to meters per second. To do this, we multiply by (1000/3600) or (5/18).\n\nSo, the relative speed in meters per second is (x - 1) * (5/18) m/s.\n\nWe are given that the train passes the man in 10 seconds. So, the distance covered by the train in 10 seconds is equal to the length of the train, which is 125 meters.\n\nUsing the formula, distance = speed * time, we can write:\n\n125 = (x - 1) * (5/18) * 10\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n125 = (x - 1) * (50/18)\n\n125 * (18/50) = x - 1\n\n(125 * 18) / 50 = x - 1\n\n2250 / 50 = x - 1\n\n45 = x - 1\n\nx = 45 + 1\n\nx = 46\n\nSo, the speed of the train is 46 km/hr.

In the 6 hours it took for the biker to take the first person across, the remaining two people have been running at 10 kmph.\nDistance covered by runners in 6 hours = 6 hours * 10 kmph = 60 km\n\nSo, the biker has to travel 300 km - 60 km = 240 km to return to the second person.\nTime = 240 km / 50 kmph = 4.8 hours\n\n3.

In the 6 hours it took for the biker to take the second person across, the third person has been running at 10 kmph.\nDistance covered by the third runner in 6 hours = 6 hours * 10 kmph = 60 km\n\nHowever, this runner had already covered 60 km when the biker was taking the first person across.

            "Response": "First, let's consider the number of 6-digit numbers that can be formed using the given digits. We have 6 available slots for the digits, and we can choose any of the 7 given digits for the first slot. For the second slot, we have 6 remaining choices, for the third slot 5 choices, and so on. So the total number of 6-digit numbers that can be formed is 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 5,040.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of 5-digit numbers that can be formed using the given digits. We have 5 available slots for the digits, and we can choose any of the 7 given digits for the first slot. However, we need to make sure that the number is greater than 1 lac (100,000), so the first digit cannot be 0. This leaves us with 6 choices for the first slot. For the second slot, we have 6 remaining choices, for the third slot 5 choices, and so on. So the total number of 5-digit numbers that can be formed is 6 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 2,160.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of 5-digit numbers that are less than or equal to 1 lac (100,000) from the total number of 5-digit numbers. Since the first digit cannot be 0, the only 5-digit numbers that are less than or equal to 1 lac are those that start with 1. There are 5 remaining choices for the second slot, 4 choices for the third slot, 3 choices for the fourth slot, and 2 choices for the fifth slot. So the total number of 5-digit numbers that are less than or equal to 1 lac is 1 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 120.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of 5-digit numbers less than or equal to 1 lac from the total number of 5-digit numbers to get the number of 5-digit numbers greater than 1 lac: 2,160 - 120 = 2,040.\n\nSo, the total number of numbers greater than 1 lac that can be formed using the given digits is the sum of the number of 6-digit numbers and the number of 5-digit numbers greater than 1 lac: 5,040 + 2,040 = 7,080.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that all numbers must be distinct. Since we have two 2's and two 3's, we need to account for the duplicate numbers. Let's consider the cases where the two 2's or the two 3's are together in the number.\n\nCase 1: The two 2's are together.\nWe can treat the two 2's as a single entity, so we have 6 available slots for the digits (5 individual digits and the pair of 2's). We can choose any of the 6 slots for the pair of 2's, and then we have 5 remaining choices for the next slot, 4 choices for the next slot, and so on. So the total number of numbers with the two 2's together is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 720.\n\nCase 2: The two 3's are together.\nSimilarly, we can treat the two 3's as a single entity, so we have 6 available slots for the digits (5 individual digits and the pair of 3's). We can choose any of the 6 slots for the pair of 3's, and then we have 5 remaining choices for the next slot, 4 choices for the next slot, and so on. So the total number of numbers with the two 3's together is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 720.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of duplicate numbers from the total number of numbers greater than 1 lac: 7,080 - 720 - 720 = 5,640.\n\nHowever, we have double-counted the numbers where both the two 2's and the two 3's are together. We need to add these back in.\n\nCase 3: Both the two 2's and the two 3's are together.\nWe can treat both pairs as single entities, so we have 5 available slots for the digits (3 individual digits, the pair of 2's, and the pair of 3's). We can choose any of the 5 slots for the pair of 2's, and then we have 4 remaining choices for the pair of 3's, 3 choices for the next slot, and so on. So the total number of numbers with both the two 2's and the two 3's together is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 = 120.\n\nFinally, we add the number of double-counted numbers back in to get the total number of distinct numbers greater than 1 lac: 5,640 + 120 = 5,760.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E) 570.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find how many factors of 5 are in the product of the integers from 1 to 150. \n\nWe can do this by dividing 150 by 5, which gives us 30. This means there are 30 numbers between 1 and 150 that are divisible by 5. However, some of these numbers have more than one factor of 5, such as 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150. \n\nTo account for these extra factors of 5, we can divide 150 by 25, which gives us 6. This means there are 6 numbers between 1 and 150 that have at least two factors of 5. \n\nFinally, we need to account for the numbers that have three factors of 5, which are 125 and 150. We can do this by dividing 150 by 125, which gives us 1.

            "Response": "First, let's find the amount of raw material B in the mixture of chemical X and chemical Y.\n\nIn chemical X, the ratio of A and B is 1 : 3. So, for every 1 unit of A, there are 3 units of B. Since the ratio of X and Y in product M is 5 : 4, let's assume there are 5 units of X and 4 units of Y in product M.\n\nNow, in these 5 units of X, there are (1+3) = 4 parts, out of which 3 parts are B. So, the amount of B in 5 units of X is (3/4)*5 = 15/4 units.\n\nIn chemical Y, the ratio of B and C is 2 : 1. So, for every 2 units of B, there is 1 unit of C. In the 4 units of Y, there are (2+1) = 3 parts, out of which 2 parts are B. So, the amount of B in 4 units of Y is (2/3)*4 = 8/3 units.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of B in product M. The total amount of B in product M is the sum of B in X and Y, which is (15/4 + 8/3) units.\n\nTo find a common denominator, we can multiply the denominators 4 and 3, which gives us 12. Now, let's convert the fractions to have the same denominator:\n\n(15/4)*(3/3) = 45/12\n(8/3)*(4/4) = 32/12\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\n(45/12) + (32/12) = (45+32)/12 = 77/12\n\nSo, there are 77/12 units of B in product M.\n\nNow, let's find the amount of B in the final mixture. Since the concentration of B in the final mixture is 50%, there must be 50% of 864 units of B in the final mixture, which is (50/100)*864 = 432 units.\n\nNow, let's find the amount of product M in the final mixture. Since there are 77/12 units of B in product M, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of product M in the final mixture:\n\n(77/12) / (Product M) = 432 / 864\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n(77/12) * 864 = 432 * (Product M)\n\nDividing both sides by 432, we get:\n\n(77/12) * 2 = Product M\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12, we get:\n\n77 * 2 = 12 * (Product M)\n\n154 = 12 * (Product M)\n\nDividing both sides by 12, we get:\n\nProduct M = 154/12 = 77/6\n\nNow, let's find the amount of water added to product M. Since the final mixture is prepared by mixing 864 units of product M with water, the amount of water added is:\n\n864 - (77/6) * 6 = 864 - 77 = 787 units\n\nSo, 787 units of water had been added to product M.\n\nThe answer is E) None of the above.",

So there are 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 different victory circles in this case.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where there is a tie for the first place (two gold medals).\n\nThere are 4 options for the non-medalist, and then 3 options for the silver medalist. So there are 4 * 3 = 12 different victory circles in this case.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where there is a tie for the second place (two silver medals).\n\nThere are 4 options for the gold medalist, and then 3 options for the non-medalist. So there are 4 * 3 = 12 different victory circles in this case.\n\nAdding up all the cases, we have 24 + 12 + 12 = 48 different victory circles. However, we need to consider that the order in which the medalists stand in the victory circle also matters. Since there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange 3 people, we need to multiply our result by 6.\n\nSo, the total number of different victory circles is 48 * 6 = 288. However, we have overcounted the cases where there are ties, as we have considered each tie as a separate arrangement. We need to divide the number of cases with ties by 2, as there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange 2 people with the same medal.\n\nFor the case with two gold medals, we have 12 / 2 = 6 different victory circles.\nFor the case with two silver medals, we have 12 / 2 = 6 different victory circles.\n\nNow, we can add up the corrected number of victory circles for each case: 24 (no ties) + 6 (two gold medals) + 6 (two silver medals) = 36 different victory circles.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our initial calculation by assuming that exactly three medals are awarded. In the case of a tie for the first place, only two medals are awarded (two gold medals and one silver medal). So, we need to subtract the number of victory circles with only two medals from our total.\n\nThere are 4 options for the non-medalist in the case of a tie for the first place, so there are 4 different victory circles with only two medals.\n\nTherefore, the correct number of different victory circles is 36 - 4 = 32.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this result. Upon reviewing the problem statement, we realize that we misinterpreted the condition \"exactly three medals are awarded.\" This means that we should not have subtracted the cases with only two medals.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 36 different victory circles, which is not among the given options.

This can be done using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (total books) and k = 3 (books to be selected). So, the total number of ways to select 3 books is:\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 books without any paperbacks. Since there are 6 hardbacks, this is the same as selecting 3 hardbacks from the 6 available. Using the combination formula again, we have:\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6*5*4) / (3*2*1) = 20\n\nNow, to find the number of selections with at least one paperback, we subtract the number of selections without any paperbacks from the total number of selections:\n\n56 (total selections) - 20 (selections without paperbacks) = 36\n\nSo, there are 36 possible selections of 3 books that include at least one paperback.

Since Company Z spent 1/4 of its revenues on marketing, it had 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of its revenues left.\n\nNext, let's find out how much of the remaining revenues were spent on maintenance. Company Z spent 1/7 of the remainder on maintenance, so it spent (3/4) * (1/7) = 3/28 of its original revenues on maintenance.\n\nNow, let's find out how much of the original revenues were left after both marketing and maintenance expenditures. We subtract the fractions spent on marketing and maintenance from the original revenues:\n\nOriginal revenues - marketing - maintenance = 1 - 1/4 - 3/28\n\nTo subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 28. So we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:\n\n28/28 - 7/28 - 3/28\n\nNow we can subtract the numerators:\n\n(28 - 7 - 3)/28 = 18/28\n\nFinally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n\n18/28 = (18/2)/(28/2) = 9/14\n\nSo Company Z had 9/14 of its original revenues left after its marketing and maintenance expenditures.

Since 10 men can complete the project in 55 days, 1 man can complete 1/10 of the project in 55 days. So, the work done by 1 man in 1 day is:\n\n(1/10) * (1/55) = 1/550\n\nNow, let's find out how much work 5 women and 4 men can do in 1 day. The work done by 5 women in 1 day is:\n\n5 * (1/825) = 5/825\n\nThe work done by 4 men in 1 day is:\n\n4 * (1/550) = 4/550\n\nSo, the total work done by 5 women and 4 men in 1 day is:\n\n(5/825) + (4/550)\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 825 and 550 is 3300. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:\n\n(20/3300) + (24/3300) = 44/3300\n\nNow, we know that 5 women and 4 men can complete 44/3300 of the project in 1 day.

We have:\n\n450 = 2 * 225 = 2 * 3^2 * 5^2\n\nNow, for n^2 to be divisible by 450, its prime factorization must include at least the prime factors of 450. In other words, n^2 must have at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5.\n\nSince n is a positive integer, its prime factorization must include at least one factor of 2, one factor of 3, and one factor of 5. This means that n must be divisible by 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.\n\nNow, let's check if any larger integer from the options must divide n. If n were divisible by 40, then n^2 would have at least three factors of 2, which is not necessary for n^2 to be divisible by 450.

In the time it took pipes A and B to fill 2/3 of the cistern, the waste pipe removed 1/3 of the cistern.

The watch was 2 minutes slow at noon on Monday and 4 minutes 48 seconds fast at 2 p.m. on the following Monday. So, the watch has gained 2 minutes + 4 minutes 48 seconds = 6 minutes 48 seconds in 170 hours.\n\nNow, let's find out how much the watch gains per hour.

This happens when the angle between them is 180 degrees.\n\nLet x be the number of minutes past 8 o'clock when this happens. In x minutes, the minute hand will move x * 6 degrees (since it moves 6 degrees per minute) and the hour hand will move x * 0.5 degrees (since it moves 0.5 degrees per minute).\n\nSo, we can write the equation:\n\n240 + x * 0.5 = x * 6 - 180\n\nSolving for x:\n\n0.5x = 6x - 420\n5.5x = 420\nx = 420 / 5.5\nx = 76.36363636\n\nNow, let's convert this to the format of the options given:\n\n76.36363636 = 10 * 76.36363636 / 10\n76.36363636 = 10 * (76.36363636 / 10)\n76.36363636 = 10 * (840 / 11)\n76.36363636 = 10 * (11 * 76.36363636 / 11)\n\nSo, the answer is 10 * 11 * 76.36363636 / 11, which is option A) 10x11/10.",

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so 40.5 seconds is equal to 40.5/3600 = 0.01125 hours.\n\nNow, we can find the speed of the train by dividing the total distance covered by the time taken.

            "Response": "First, let's find out how much water is in tank B after 21 hours. We know that the amount of water in tank B doubles every hour. So, after 21 hours, the amount of water in tank B is:\n\n10 * 2^0 + 10 * 2^1 + 10 * 2^2 + ... + 10 * 2^20\n\nThis is a geometric series with 21 terms, a common ratio of 2, and a first term of 10. The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\nS = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nS = 10 * (1 - 2^21) / (1 - 2)\n\nS = 10 * (1 - 2^21) / (-1)\n\nS = 10 * (2^21 - 1)\n\nNow, we know that this amount of water is 1/32 of the total capacity of tank B. Let's denote the total capacity of tank B as C. Then, we have:\n\nC / 32 = 10 * (2^21 - 1)\n\nTo find the total capacity, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 32:\n\nC = 320 * (2^21 - 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the total duration required to fill tank B completely. Since the amount of water in tank B doubles every hour, we can represent the total capacity as a geometric series with a common ratio of 2 and a first term of 10:\n\nC = 10 * (1 - 2^n) / (1 - 2)\n\nTo find the total duration, we need to find the value of n for which this equation holds true. We can set the two expressions for C equal to each other:\n\n320 * (2^21 - 1) = 10 * (1 - 2^n) / (1 - 2)\n\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n\n32 * (2^21 - 1) = (1 - 2^n) / (1 - 2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1 - 2), we get:\n\n32 * (2^21 - 1) * (1 - 2) = 1 - 2^n\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n32 * (2^21 - 1) * (-1) = 1 - 2^n\n\n-32 * (2^21 - 1) = 1 - 2^n\n\nNow, we need to find the value of n that satisfies this equation. Since the amount of water in tank B doubles every hour, n must be an integer. We can try different values of n and see which one works:\n\nFor n = 22, we have:\n\n-32 * (2^21 - 1) = 1 - 2^22\n\n-32 * (2^21 - 1) = 1 - 4 * 2^21\n\n-32 * (2^21 - 1) = -4 * 2^21 + 1\n\nThis equation holds true, so the total duration required to fill tank B completely is 22 hours.

So, the number of ways to choose 4 chairs out of 5 is:\n\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5! / (4!1!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / (4*3*2*1) = 5\n\nNow, we know that there are 75 different combinations possible. Since we have 5 ways to choose the chairs, we can find the number of ways to choose the tables by dividing the total combinations by the chair combinations:\n\n75 (total combinations) / 5 (chair combinations) = 15 (table combinations)\n\nSo, there must be a certain number of tables in the warehouse that allows for 15 different combinations when choosing 4 tables.

So we can write the equation:\n\n3x = 2(x + 4) + 8\n\nNow let's solve for x:\n\n3x = 2x + 8 + 8\n3x - 2x = 16\nx = 16\n\nSo the first odd integer is 16. But 16 is not odd, so we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and check our equation.\n\nWe wrote the second and third odd integers as x + 2 and x + 4, but since x is odd, x + 2 and x + 4 are both even. So we should have written the second and third odd integers as x + 2 and x + 4, where x is even.\n\nNow let's try solving the equation again:\n\n3x = 2(x + 4) + 8\n\n3x = 2x + 8 + 8\n3x - 2x = 16\nx = 16\n\nSo the first even integer is 16.

Then, we can write the equation:\n\nx + (x + 100) = 90t\n\nThis is because the sum of the distances travelled by both trains is equal to the distance between P and Q.\n\nNow, we can also write the equation for the distance travelled by each train in terms of time:\n\nx = 40t (for the second train)\nx + 100 = 50t (for the first train)\n\nNow, we can solve these equations to find the value of x and t:\n\nFrom the first equation, x = 40t.

            "Response": "First, let's find the possible values of x and y based on the given conditions.\n\nFor x:\n(x+1)^2 <= 16\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n|x+1| <= 4\n\nThis means that -4 <= x+1 <= 4, which gives us the possible values of x as -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nFor y:\n(y-1)^2 < 64\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n|y-1| < 8\n\nThis means that -8 < y-1 < 8, which gives us the possible values of y as -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nNow, let's find the maximum and minimum possible values of xy.\n\nTo maximize xy, we can either have both x and y be positive or both be negative. Since the largest positive value of x is 3 and the largest positive value of y is 9, the maximum value of xy is 3*9 = 27. However, we can also have both x and y be negative. The smallest negative value of x is -5 and the smallest negative value of y is -6, so the maximum value of xy in this case is -5*(-6) = 30. Therefore, the overall maximum value of xy is 30.\n\nTo minimize xy, we can have one of x and y be positive and the other be negative. The largest positive value of x is 3 and the smallest negative value of y is -6, so the minimum value of xy in this case is 3*(-6) = -18. Similarly, the smallest positive value of y is 1 and the largest negative value of x is -5, so the minimum value of xy in this case is -5*1 = -5.

In total, there are 5 + 1 = 6 factors of 5 in x.\n\nFor the other prime numbers (7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23), there is only one multiple of each between 1 and 25, so there is only one factor of each in x.\n\nNow we have the prime factorization of x: x = 2^22 * 3^10 * 5^6 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23.\n\nNext, we need to find the greatest value of k for which y = 100^k is a factor of x. Since 100 = 2^2 * 5^2, we need to find the highest power of 100 that divides x.\n\nWe have 22 factors of 2 and 6 factors of 5 in x. Since 100 = 2^2 * 5^2, we can make 11 factors of 100 from the factors of 2 and 3 factors of 100 from the factors of 5. Therefore, the greatest value of k for which y is a factor of x is the minimum of these two values, which is 3.\n\nSo the answer is C) 3.",

Since there are 12 hours on the clock, each hour mark is 360\u00b0/12 = 30\u00b0 apart. The minute hand is at the 8, which is 4 hours away from the 12, so its angle is 4 * 30\u00b0 = 120\u00b0.\n\nNow let's find the angle of the hour hand with respect to the 12 on the clock. Since there are 12 hours on the clock, each hour mark is 360\u00b0/12 = 30\u00b0 apart. The hour hand is 2/3 of the way between the 3 and the 4, so its angle is (3 + 2/3) * 30\u00b0 = 3.67 * 30\u00b0 \u2248 110\u00b0.\n\nFinally, let's find the angle between the hour and minute hands. Since the minute hand is at a larger angle, we can subtract the angle of the hour hand from the angle of the minute hand: 120\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 10\u00b0.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options.

The hour hand moves 360\u00b0 in 12 hours, so at 3 hours and 40 minutes, it has moved (3 + 40/60) * 360\u00b0/12 = 3.67 * 30\u00b0 \u2248 110\u00b0.\n\nNow let's find the angle between the hour and minute hands again.

We also know that the bottom of the ladder is 6 feet from the base of the wall, so a = 6. We can now solve for b:\n\n6^2 + b^2 = 18^2\n36 + b^2 = 324\nb^2 = 288\nb = sqrt(288) = 16.97 (approximately)\n\nSo the height at which the ladder is touching the wall is approximately 16.97 feet.\n\nNow, let's say that the top of the ladder slips down 4 feet. This means that the new height at which the ladder is touching the wall is 16.97 - 4 = 12.97 feet.\n\nWe can now use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the new distance of the bottom of the ladder from the base of the wall:\n\na^2 + 12.97^2 = 18^2\na^2 + 168.25 = 324\na^2 = 155.75\na = sqrt(155.75) = 12.48 (approximately)\n\nSo the new distance of the bottom of the ladder from the base of the wall is approximately 12.48 feet.\n\nTo find how many feet the bottom of the ladder slipped, we can subtract the original distance from the new distance:\n\n12.48 - 6 = 6.48\n\nTherefore, the bottom of the ladder slipped approximately 6.48 feet.

            "Response": "First, let's find the first term of the sequence. We know that the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:\n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, we have:\n\n140 = (20 * (a1 + a20)) / 2\n\nSince each term is obtained by adding 2 to the preceding one, we can express a20 as a1 + 19 * 2 = a1 + 38. Now we can plug this back into the equation:\n\n140 = (20 * (a1 + a1 + 38)) / 2\n\nSimplify and solve for a1:\n\n140 = (20 * (2a1 + 38)) / 2\n140 = 10 * (2a1 + 38)\n14 = 2a1 + 38\n-24 = 2a1\na1 = -12\n\nNow that we have the first term, we can find the 40th term, a40:\n\na40 = a1 + 39 * 2 = -12 + 78 = 66\n\nFinally, we can find the sum of the first 40 terms using the same formula as before:\n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\nSum = (40 * (-12 + 66)) / 2\nSum = (40 * 54) / 2\nSum = 20 * 54\nSum = 1080\n\nSo the result of the addition of the first 40 terms is 1080, which is option B.",

So, 1/2 hectare = 5,000 square meters.\n\nNow, we can find the side of the square:\nside^2 = 5,000\nside = \u221a5,000\nside = 50\u221a2 meters\n\nNow, we can find the diagonal of the square using the Pythagorean theorem. The diagonal of a square divides it into two right-angled triangles, with the side of the square as the legs and the diagonal as the hypotenuse.\n\nLet d be the diagonal of the square. Then,\nd^2 = side^2 + side^2\nd^2 = (50\u221a2)^2 + (50\u221a2)^2\nd^2 = 2(50^2) + 2(50^2)\nd^2 = 4(50^2)\nd = \u221a(4(50^2))\nd = 2(50)\nd = 100 meters\n\nSo, the diagonal of the square is 100 meters.

Since the owner is going faster, we will subtract the thief's speed from the owner's speed:\n\nRelative speed = Owner's speed - Thief's speed\nRelative speed = 72 kmph - 22 kmph = 50 kmph\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it will take for the owner to cover the 11 km distance between him and the thief. To do this, we will use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative speed\nTime = 11 km / 50 kmph = 11/50 hours\n\nSo, the owner will overtake the thief after 11/50 hours from the start.\n\nThe correct answer is B) 11/25 hours.",

            "Response": "First, let's find the weight loss per kg for both tin and silver.\n\nFor tin:\nWeight loss = 1.375 kg (for 10 kg of tin)\nSo, weight loss per kg of tin = 1.375 / 10 = 0.1375 kg\n\nFor silver:\nWeight loss = 0.375 kg (for 5 kg of silver)\nSo, weight loss per kg of silver = 0.375 / 5 = 0.075 kg\n\nNow, let's assume there are x kg of tin and y kg of silver in the 30 kg metal bar. We have two equations:\n\n1) x + y = 30 (since the total weight of the bar is 30 kg)\n2) 0.1375x + 0.075y = 3 (since the bar loses 3 kg of its weight in the water)\n\nNow we can solve these two equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nFirst, let's multiply equation 1 by 0.075 to make the coefficients of y the same in both equations:\n\n0.075x + 0.075y = 2.25\n\nNow, subtract this new equation from equation 2:\n\n(0.1375x + 0.075y) - (0.075x + 0.075y) = 3 - 2.25\n0.0625x = 0.75\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.0625 to find the value of x:\n\nx = 0.75 / 0.0625 = 12\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y using equation 1:\n\n12 + y = 30\ny = 30 - 12 = 18\n\nSo, there are 12 kg of tin and 18 kg of silver in the 30 kg metal bar. The ratio of tin to silver is:\n\n12 : 18\n\nWe can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (6):\n\n12/6 : 18/6 = 2 : 3\n\nSo, the ratio of tin to silver in the bar is 2 : 3, which is option E.",

The time it takes to drive to the picnic spot at an average speed of 40 m/h is x/40 hours. The time it takes to drive back from the picnic spot at an average speed of 30 m/h is x/30 hours.\n\nThe total time spent driving during the weekend trip should not exceed 16 hours, so we can write the inequality:\n\nx/40 + x/30 <= 16\n\nTo solve this inequality, we can find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 120. So, we can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n3x/120 + 4x/120 <= 16\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions:\n\n(3x + 4x)/120 <= 16\n\n7x/120 <= 16\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by 120 to isolate the variable:\n\n7x <= 16 * 120\n\n7x <= 1920\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 7:\n\nx <= 274.29\n\nSo, the maximum distance to the picnic spot is 274.29 miles.

Let's analyze the options:\n\nA) 120 miles: This is a valid option, as it is less than 274.29 miles.\nB) Between 120 and 140 miles: This is also a valid option, as it is within the range of possible distances.\nC) 160 miles: This is a valid option, as it is less than 274.29 miles.\nD) 180 miles: This is a valid option, as it is less than 274.29 miles.\nE) 260 miles: This is a valid option, as it is less than 274.29 miles.\n\nSince all the options are valid, the best answer is B) between 120 and 140 miles, as it provides a more specific range of distances for the picnic spot.",

            "Response": "First, we need to find the probability of rolling an 8 with two six-sided dice. There are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. There are 5 ways to roll an 8: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), and (6,2). So the probability of rolling an 8 is 5/36.\n\nNow, Taequan needs to roll an 8 again on his second try. The probability of this happening is also 5/36. Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities together to find the probability of both events happening:\n\n(5/36) * (5/36) = 25/1296 = 1/51.84\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices.

            "Response": "1. First, we need to find out how many units are rented in total. Since 4 out of every 7 units are rented, we can calculate the total number of rented units by multiplying the total number of units (441) by 4/7:\n\n   Rented units = 441 * (4/7) = 252\n\n2. Now we know that 1/5 of the one-bedroom units are rented. Let x be the total number of one-bedroom units. Then, the number of rented one-bedroom units is (1/5)x.\n\n3. We also know that there is a 6:1 ratio of two-bedroom units to one-bedroom units among the rented apartments. So, for every 6 two-bedroom units rented, there is 1 one-bedroom unit rented. This means that the number of rented two-bedroom units is 6 times the number of rented one-bedroom units:\n\n   Rented two-bedroom units = 6 * (1/5)x = (6/5)x\n\n4. The total number of rented units is the sum of rented one-bedroom and two-bedroom units:\n\n   252 = (1/5)x + (6/5)x\n\n5. To solve for x, we can combine the fractions:\n\n   252 = (1/5)x + (6/5)x = (7/5)x\n\n6. Now, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 5/7:\n\n   x = 252 * (5/7) = 180\n\nSo, there are 180 one-bedroom units in total.\n\n7. Since 1/5 of the one-bedroom units are rented, there are (1/5) * 180 = 36 rented one-bedroom units.\n\n8. Now, we can find the total number of two-bedroom units by subtracting the total number of one-bedroom units from the total number of units:\n\n   Two-bedroom units = 441 - 180 = 261\n\n9. We know that there is a 6:1 ratio of rented two-bedroom units to rented one-bedroom units. So, there are 6 * 36 = 216 rented two-bedroom units.\n\n10. Finally, we can find the number of two-bedroom units that are not rented by subtracting the number of rented two-bedroom units from the total number of two-bedroom units:\n\n   Not rented two-bedroom units = 261 - 216 = 45\n\nSo, there are 45 two-bedroom units that are not rented.

            "Response": "Step 1: Find the cost of 60 litres of milk\nThe cost of 1.5 litres of milk is Rs. 20, so the cost of 60 litres of milk can be found by setting up a proportion:\n\n1.5 litres : Rs. 20 = 60 litres : x\n\nCross-multiply and solve for x:\n\n1.5x = 20 * 60\nx = (20 * 60) / 1.5\nx = 1200 / 1.5\nx = 800\n\nSo, the cost of 60 litres of milk is Rs. 800.\n\nStep 2: Find the cost per litre of the final mixture\nThe final mixture should be worth Rs. 32/3 per litre.\n\nStep 3: Set up an equation to find the amount of water to be added\nLet x be the amount of water to be added.

Let's assume the time taken by Usha to complete the race is t seconds. Then, the time taken by Shiny to run 950 m is also t seconds.\n4. Now, we need to find the speed of Shiny. Speed = Distance/Time. So, Shiny's speed = 950/t m/s.\n5. We also need to find the time taken by Mercy to complete the race. Since Mercy runs at 4 m/s, the time taken by Mercy to complete 1000 m is 1000/4 = 250 seconds.\n6. Now, we need to find the time margin by which Shiny beats Mercy. Let's assume this time margin is x seconds.\n7. So, the time taken by Shiny to complete the race is (250 - x) seconds.\n8. Now, we can equate the two expressions for Shiny's speed: 950/t = 950/(250 - x).\n9. From this equation, we can see that t = 250 - x.\n10. Now, we need to find the speed of Usha. Since Usha completes the race in t seconds, her speed = 1000/t m/s.\n11. We can now equate the two expressions for Usha's speed: 1000/t = 1000/(250 - x).\n12.

The total valid votes are 0.5x - 0.05x = 0.45x.\n5. A candidate got 5000 votes, which were 50% of the total votes cast, so 5000 = 0.5 * 0.5x.\n6. Solving for x, we get x = 5000 / (0.5 * 0.5) = 5000 / 0.25 = 20000.\n\nSo, if we assume that the candidate got 50% of the total votes cast, the total number of votes enrolled in the election would be 20,000.

            "Query": "A license plate in the country Kerrania consists of four digits followed by two letters. The letters A, B, and C are used only by government vehicles while the letters D through Z are used by non-government vehicles. Kerrania's intelligence agency has recently captured a message from the country Gonzalia indicating that an electronic transmitter has been installed in a Kerrania government vehicle with a license plate starting with 79. If it takes the police 9 minutes to inspect each vehicle, what is the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours?\nOptions:  A)18/79 B)1/6 C)1/45 D)1/50 E)1/900  Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, let's find out how many government vehicles have license plates starting with 79. Since there are 3 possible letters (A, B, and C) for each of the last two positions, there are 3 * 3 = 9 possible combinations of letters for a government vehicle's license plate.\n\nNow, let's find out how many total vehicles have license plates starting with 79. There are 10 possible digits for each of the two remaining positions, so there are 10 * 10 = 100 possible combinations of digits for a vehicle's license plate.\n\nTherefore, there are 100 - 9 = 91 non-government vehicles with license plates starting with 79.\n\nIn three hours, there are 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Since it takes 9 minutes to inspect each vehicle, the police can inspect 180 / 9 = 20 vehicles in three hours.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours. Since there are 9 government vehicles and 20 vehicles can be inspected in three hours, the probability is 9 / (9 + 91) = 9 / 100 = 1/11.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. Let's check if we made a mistake in our calculations.\n\nWe know that there are 9 government vehicles and 91 non-government vehicles with license plates starting with 79. We also know that the police can inspect 20 vehicles in three hours. The probability of finding the transmitter in the first vehicle inspected is 9/100. If the transmitter is not found in the first vehicle, the probability of finding it in the second vehicle is 8/99 (since there are now 8 government vehicles left and 99 total vehicles left). We can continue this process for all 20 vehicles.\n\nThe probability of finding the transmitter within three hours is the sum of the probabilities of finding it in each of the 20 vehicles inspected:\n\nP(transmitter in first vehicle) + P(transmitter in second vehicle | not in first vehicle) + ... + P(transmitter in 20th vehicle | not in first 19 vehicles)\n\n= 9/100 + (91/100)(8/99) + ... + (81/100)(9/80)\n\n= 9/100 + 8/110 + ... + 9/180\n\nThis is a complicated expression, but we can notice that the numerator of each fraction is either 8 or 9, and the denominators are all between 100 and 180. This means that each term in the sum is between 8/180 and 9/100, which is between 1/22.5 and 9/100.\n\nSince there are 20 terms in the sum, the total probability is between 20 * 1/22.5 and 20 * 9/100, which is between 20/22.5 and 9/5. This means that the probability is between 0.888 and 1.8.\n\nThe only option that falls within this range is 1/6, so the correct answer is B) 1/6.",

So, we have:\n\n1 job = 1 \u00d7 16 days\n\nFor B, the work is still 1 job, but the efficiency is 1.6. We need to find the time B takes to do the job. Let's call this time \"t\". So, we have:\n\n1 job = 1.6 \u00d7 t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt = 1 job / 1.6 = 0.625 jobs\n\nNow, we need to convert this fraction back into days. Since 1 job takes 16 days for A, we can set up a proportion:\n\n0.625 jobs / 1 job = t days / 16 days\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n0.625 jobs \u00d7 16 days = 1 job \u00d7 t days\n\n10 days = t days\n\nSo, B alone takes 10 days to do the same job.

This means that the total work is 22 units.\n\nSince B is 1.3 times more efficient than A, B can do 1.3 units of work in 1 day.\n\nNow, we need to find how many days B alone takes to do the same job (22 units of work).\n\nLet's assume B takes x days to do the job.\n\nIn 1 day, B can do 1.3 units of work.

            "Response": "First, let's find the total capacity of the four barrels. Since their average capacity is 8 gallons, we can multiply this by the number of barrels to find the total capacity:\n\nTotal capacity = 4 barrels * 8 gallons/barrel = 32 gallons\n\nNow, let's consider the median. Since there are four barrels, the median will be the average of the capacities of the second and third largest barrels. We are given that the median is 10 gallons, so:\n\n(Second largest barrel + Third largest barrel) / 2 = 10 gallons\n\nSecond largest barrel + Third largest barrel = 20 gallons\n\nNow, let's think about the maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel, Q. In order for Q to have the maximum possible capacity, the other three barrels must have the minimum possible capacities while still satisfying the median condition. Since the second and third largest barrels have a combined capacity of 20 gallons, the minimum possible capacities for these barrels would be 10 gallons each.\n\nNow we can find the capacity of the largest barrel. Since the total capacity of all four barrels is 32 gallons, and the second and third largest barrels have a combined capacity of 20 gallons, the combined capacity of the smallest and largest barrels is:\n\n32 gallons - 20 gallons = 12 gallons\n\nSince we want to maximize the capacity of the smallest barrel, Q, we should minimize the capacity of the largest barrel. The smallest possible capacity for the largest barrel would be 10 gallons (since it must be at least as large as the second and third largest barrels).\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel, Q:\n\n12 gallons - 10 gallons = 2 gallons\n\nSo the maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel, Q, is 2 gallons.

            "Response": "First, let's find the minimum number of books we need to remove to ensure that we have at least 80 books of the same science.\n\nIf we remove 79 books, it's possible that we could have 79 books with each book being from a different science (for example, 16 botany, 16 zoology, 16 physics, 16 geology, and 15 chemistry). In this case, we wouldn't have 80 books of the same science yet.\n\nHowever, if we remove 80 books, it's guaranteed that at least one science will have 80 books removed. This is because if we try to distribute the 80 books evenly among the 5 sciences, one of the sciences will have at least $\\lceil\\frac{80}{5}\\rceil = 16$ more books removed than it started with. Since the smallest starting number of books for any science is 50 (botany and geology), this means that we'll have at least 80 books removed for one science.\n\nSo, we need to remove at least 80 books to ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science.

So, in these x days, the company produced 30x parts.\n\nAccording to the problem, by the last day of work, the company produced 100 more parts than planned.

This can be done using combinations, which is denoted as C(n, k) or \"n choose k\", where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be chosen. The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nSo for the mathematics department, we have:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 7! / (3!4!) = (7*6*5) / (3*2*1) = 35\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to select 5 candidates out of 8 for the computer science department. Using the same formula, we have:\n\nC(8, 5) = 8! / (5!(8-5)!) = 8! / (5!3!) = (8*7*6) / (3*2*1) = 56\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to select the 3 candidates for the 3 positions. Since the positions in the computer science department are identical, we can treat them as a single position. So we have:\n\nTotal number of ways = (Number of ways to select 3 candidates for math) * (Number of ways to select 5 candidates for computer science)\n\nTotal number of ways = 35 * 56 = 1960\n\nHowever, we have counted the cases where the same candidate is selected for both the math and computer science positions twice.

            "Response": "Let's assume that Company S produced 60 stereos last month. Then, 2/3 * 60 = 40 stereos were basic, and 60 - 40 = 20 stereos were deluxe.\n\nLet's also assume that it takes 1 hour to produce a basic stereo. Then, it takes 1.2 hours to produce a deluxe stereo.\n\nThe total number of hours it took to produce the basic stereos is 40 * 1 = 40 hours.\nThe total number of hours it took to produce the deluxe stereos is 20 * 1.2 = 24 hours.\n\nNow, we need to find the fraction of the total number of hours it took to produce the deluxe stereos out of the total number of hours it took to produce all the stereos.\n\nThe total number of hours it took to produce all the stereos is 40 + 24 = 64 hours.\n\nSo, the fraction we are looking for is 24/64.

            "Response": "First, let's find the dimensions of the figure created by the 128 cubes. Since the width is twice the length and twice the height, let the length be x, the height be y, and the width be 2x and 2y. Then, the volume of the figure is x * y * (2x) * (2y) = 128.\n\nNow, let's find the dimensions of the foil-covered prism. Since each side of the prism is covered in foil, we need to add 2 to each dimension of the figure created by the 128 cubes. So, the dimensions of the foil-covered prism are (x+2), (y+2), (2x+2), and (2y+2).\n\nWe are asked to find the width of the foil-covered prism, which is (2x+2). To do this, we first need to find the values of x and y.\n\nFrom the equation x * y * (2x) * (2y) = 128, we can simplify to 4x^2 * y^2 = 128. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x^2 * y^2 = 32.\n\nNow, we need to find the factors of 32. The possible pairs of factors are (1, 32), (2, 16), and (4, 8). Since the width is twice the length and twice the height, we can eliminate the pairs (1, 32) and (2, 16) because they do not satisfy this condition. So, the only possible pair is (4, 8).\n\nThus, x = 4 and y = 2. Now, we can find the width of the foil-covered prism: (2x+2) = (2*4+2) = 10.\n\nSo, the width of the foil-covered prism is 10 inches.

Since the train completely crosses the bridge, the total distance is the sum of the train's length and the bridge's length:\n\nTotal distance = Train length + Bridge length\nTotal distance = 250 meters + 300 meters\nTotal distance = 550 meters\n\nNext, we need to find the speed of the train. Speed is defined as the distance covered per unit of time. In this case, the train covers 550 meters in 45 seconds. So, we can find the speed by dividing the total distance by the time taken:\n\nSpeed = Total distance / Time taken\nSpeed = 550 meters / 45 seconds\n\nNow, we can calculate the speed:\n\nSpeed = 550 / 45\nSpeed \u2248 12.22 meters/second\n\nHowever, the options are given in km/h. To convert the speed from meters/second to km/h, we can use the following conversion factor:\n\n1 meter/second = 3.6 km/h\n\nSo, the speed of the train in km/h is:\n\nSpeed \u2248 12.22 * 3.6\nSpeed \u2248 44 km/h\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D) 44.",

            "Response": "1. First, let's find out how far the cyclist travels in 5 minutes. Since the cyclist is traveling at 28 miles per hour, we can convert this to miles per minute by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the cyclist travels 28/60 = 7/15 miles per minute.\n\n2. In 5 minutes, the cyclist travels 5 * (7/15) = 35/15 = 7/3 miles.\n\n3. Now, let's find out how long it takes the hiker to cover this distance. Since the hiker is traveling at a constant rate of 7 miles per hour, we can convert this to miles per minute by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the hiker travels 7/60 miles per minute.\n\n4. To find out how many minutes it takes the hiker to cover the 7/3 miles, we can set up a proportion: (7/60) / (x minutes) = (7/3) / (5 minutes). Cross-multiplying, we get 7/3 * x = 7/60 * 5. \n\n5. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/7: x = (7/60 * 5) * (3/7). The 7's cancel out, and we're left with x = 5 * 3/60 = 15/60.\n\n6. Simplifying, we get x = 15/60 = 1/4. So, it takes the hiker 1/4 of an hour to cover the 7/3 miles. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 1/4 * 60 = 15 minutes.\n\n7. Since the cyclist has already waited for 5 minutes, the total waiting time for the cyclist is 5 + 15 = 20 minutes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C) 20.",

            "Response": "First, let's find the radius of each tank. We know that the circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. \n\nFor tank A, we have C = 12 meters. So, 12 = 2\u03c0r_A, which means r_A = 12 / (2\u03c0) = 6/\u03c0 meters.\n\nFor tank B, we have C = 10 meters. So, 10 = 2\u03c0r_B, which means r_B = 10 / (2\u03c0) = 5/\u03c0 meters.\n\nNow, let's find the volume of each tank. The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nFor tank A, we have r_A = 6/\u03c0 meters and h_A = 10 meters. So, V_A = \u03c0(6/\u03c0)^2 * 10 = (36/\u03c0) * 10 = 360/\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\nFor tank B, we have r_B = 5/\u03c0 meters and h_B = 12 meters. So, V_B = \u03c0(5/\u03c0)^2 * 12 = (25/\u03c0) * 12 = 300/\u03c0 cubic meters.\n\nNow, we want to find the capacity of tank A as a percentage of the capacity of tank B. This is given by the ratio (V_A / V_B) * 100%.\n\n(V_A / V_B) * 100% = (360/\u03c0) / (300/\u03c0) * 100% = (360/300) * 100% = 1.2 * 100% = 120%.\n\nSo, the capacity of tank A is 120% of the capacity of tank B.

We can write the equation:\n\nA's speed * y = C's speed * y + 200\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of B's speed to A's speed and C's speed to A's speed.\n\nB's speed / A's speed = 900 / 1000 = 9/10\nC's speed / A's speed = 800 / 1000 = 4/5\n\nNow, let's find the time it takes for B to catch up to C. Let z be this time. In this time, B would have run 1000 meters, and C would have run 1000 - start = 1000 - start meters. We can write the equation:\n\nB's speed * z = C's speed * z + start\n\nNow, we can substitute the ratios we found earlier:\n\n(9/10) * A's speed * z = (4/5) * A's speed * z + start\n\nNow, we can cancel out A's speed from both sides:\n\n(9/10) * z = (4/5) * z + start\n\nNow, we can solve for start:\n\nstart = z * (9/10 - 4/5)\nstart = z * (1/10)\n\nNow, we know that when B runs 1000 meters, C runs 1000 - start meters. So, we can write:\n\n1000 - start = C's speed * z\n\nSubstituting the expression for start, we get:\n\n1000 - z * (1/10) = (4/5) * A's speed * z\n\nNow, we can substitute the ratio of C's speed to A's speed:\n\n1000 - z * (1/10) = (4/5) * (4/5) * A's speed * z\n\nNow, we can cancel out A's speed from both sides:\n\n1000 - z * (1/10) = (16/25) * z\n\nNow, we can solve for z:\n\nz = 1000 / (1/10 + 16/25)\nz = 1000 / (41/50)\nz = 1000 * (50/41)\nz = 50000 / 41\nz \u2248 1219.51\n\nNow, we can find the start:\n\nstart = z * (1/10)\nstart \u2248 1219.51 * (1/10)\nstart \u2248 121.95\n\nSo, B can give C approximately 121.95 meters start in a kilometer race.

We know that 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hr = 3600 s.

            "Query": "Yukou enjoys reading science-fiction. It is the New Year and he has made a resolution to read a book every week for this year. He has a collection of monster books and space travel books in the ratio of 4:5. He presently has 20 space travel books. How many more books (of each genre) does he need to buy to keep his resolution, without changing the ratio?\nOptions:  A)6 monster, 10 space B)8 monster, 10 space C)8 monster, 9 space D)4 monster, 10 space E)7 monster, 12 space  Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, let's find out how many monster books Yukou has. Since the ratio of monster books to space travel books is 4:5, and he has 20 space travel books, we can set up a proportion:\n\n4/5 = x/20\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n5x = 4 * 20\n5x = 80\nx = 16\n\nSo Yukou has 16 monster books.\n\nNow, let's find out how many books he needs to read for the entire year. Since he wants to read a book every week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, he needs to read 52 books.\n\nHe currently has 16 monster books + 20 space travel books = 36 books.\n\nTo keep his resolution, he needs to buy 52 - 36 = 16 more books.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of each genre he needs to buy without changing the ratio. Let's call the number of monster books he needs to buy m and the number of space travel books he needs to buy s. We know that:\n\nm + s = 16 (since he needs to buy 16 more books)\nm/s = 4/5 (since the ratio needs to stay the same)\n\nNow we can solve this system of equations. We can express m in terms of s from the first equation:\n\nm = 16 - s\n\nNow we can substitute this expression into the second equation:\n\n(16 - s)/s = 4/5\n\nTo solve for s, we can cross-multiply:\n\n5(16 - s) = 4s\n80 - 5s = 4s\n9s = 80\ns = 80/9 \u2248 8.89\n\nSince he can't buy a fraction of a book, he needs to buy 9 space travel books. Now we can find the number of monster books he needs to buy:\n\nm = 16 - s\nm = 16 - 9\nm = 7\n\nSo Yukou needs to buy 7 monster books and 9 space travel books to keep his resolution without changing the ratio.

            "Query": "In a certain mathematical activity, we have five cards with five different prime numbers on them. We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512  Let's think step by step.",
            "Response": "First, let's consider the number of ways to distribute the 5 cards among the 3 envelopes. We can use stars and bars method for this. We have 5 cards (stars) and we need to divide them into 3 groups (envelopes), so we need 2 bars. The total number of ways to arrange the 5 stars and 2 bars is (7 choose 2) = 21.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of ways to order the 3 envelope numbers. For each distribution of cards, there are 3! = 6 ways to order the envelope numbers. However, we need to be careful about overcounting. If an envelope has no cards, its number is 1, and there can be at most one such envelope. If there are two envelopes with no cards, then there is only 1 way to order the envelope numbers, not 6. So, we need to subtract the overcounted cases.\n\nLet's count the number of distributions with two envelopes having no cards. There are 3 ways to choose which envelope gets all the cards. For each of these 3 cases, there is only 1 way to order the envelope numbers (since two of them are 1). So, we have overcounted 3 * (6 - 1) = 15 cases.\n\nThus, the total number of different K sets is 21 * 6 - 15 = 126 - 15 = 111. However, we need to subtract 1 from this because the case where all envelopes have no cards (i.e., all numbers are 1) is not a valid K set. So, the final answer is 111 - 1 = 110.\n\nHowever, 110 is not in the given options. Let's check if we made any mistakes in our calculations.\n\nWe used the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to distribute the 5 cards among the 3 envelopes. However, this method assumes that the order of the cards within each envelope matters, which is not the case here. So, we need to adjust our calculations to account for this.\n\nLet's consider the number of ways to distribute the 5 cards among the 3 envelopes without considering the order of the cards within each envelope:\n\n1. All 5 cards in one envelope: There are 3 ways to choose which envelope gets all the cards.\n2. 4 cards in one envelope, 1 card in another envelope: There are 3 ways to choose which envelope gets 4 cards, and 2 ways to choose which envelope gets 1 card. There are (5 choose 4) = 5 ways to choose which 4 cards go in the first envelope. So, there are 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 ways for this case.\n3. 3 cards in one envelope, 2 cards in another envelope: There are 3 ways to choose which envelope gets 3 cards, and 2 ways to choose which envelope gets 2 cards. There are (5 choose 3) = 10 ways to choose which 3 cards go in the first envelope. So, there are 3 * 2 * 10 = 60 ways for this case.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to distribute the 5 cards among the 3 envelopes without considering the order of the cards within each envelope is 3 + 30 + 60 = 93.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of ways to order the 3 envelope numbers. For each distribution of cards, there are 3! = 6 ways to order the envelope numbers. However, we need to be careful about overcounting. If an envelope has no cards, its number is 1, and there can be at most one such envelope. If there are two envelopes with no cards, then there is only 1 way to order the envelope numbers, not 6. So, we need to subtract the overcounted cases.\n\nLet's count the number of distributions with two envelopes having no cards. There are 3 ways to choose which envelope gets all the cards. For each of these 3 cases, there is only 1 way to order the envelope numbers (since two of them are 1). So, we have overcounted 3 * (6 - 1) = 15 cases.\n\nThus, the total number of different K sets is 93 * 6 - 15 = 558 - 15 = 543. However, we need to subtract 1 from this because the case where all envelopes have no cards (i.e., all numbers are 1) is not a valid K set. So, the final answer is 543 - 1 = 542.\n\nHowever, 542 is not in the given options either. It seems that there might be an error in the problem statement or the given options.",

The man sold the oranges at the rate of 12 a rupee, so he received 12 rupees for 1 orange. Since he lost 4%, the selling price of 1 orange is 96% of the cost price. So, we can write the equation:\n\nSelling Price = 0.96 * Cost Price\n12 = 0.96 * C\n\n3. Now, we need to find the cost price (C) from the equation:\n\nC = 12 / 0.96\nC = 12.5\n\n4.

Since the volume of the larger cube is 343 cubic inches, and the cube has equal side lengths, we can find the side length by taking the cube root of the volume:\n\nSide length of larger cube = cube root of 343 = 7 inches\n\nNow we can find the surface area of the larger cube. The surface area of a cube is given by the formula:\n\nSurface area = 6 * side^2\n\nSo the surface area of the larger cube is:\n\nSurface area = 6 * 7^2 = 6 * 49 = 294 square inches\n\nNow let's find the surface area of one of the smaller cubes.

            "Response": "First, let's convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s. We know that 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hr = 3600 s. So, 54 km/hr = (54 * 1000) / 3600 = 15 m/s.\n\nNow, let's find the length of the train. Since the train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of the train = Speed of the train * Time taken to pass the man\nLength of the train = 15 m/s * 20 s = 300 m\n\nNext, let's find the time taken by the train to pass the platform alone (without the man). Since the train takes 36 seconds to pass the platform and the man, and 20 seconds to pass the man alone, the time taken to pass the platform alone is:\n\nTime taken to pass the platform = 36 s - 20 s = 16 s\n\nNow, we can find the length of the platform using the formula:\n\nLength of the platform = (Speed of the train * Time taken to pass the platform) - Length of the train\nLength of the platform = (15 m/s * 16 s) - 300 m = 240 m\n\nSo, the length of the platform is 240 meters.

            "Response": "First, let's find the total number of 5-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition. Since 0 cannot be the first digit, there are 5 choices for the first digit. After choosing the first digit, there are 5 remaining choices for the second digit, 4 remaining choices for the third digit, 3 remaining choices for the fourth digit, and 2 remaining choices for the fifth digit. So, there are a total of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 600 possible 5-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's find the number of these 5-digit numbers that are divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 15, which is divisible by 3. So, any 5-digit number formed using these digits without repetition will have a sum of digits that is divisible by 3.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the cases where the 5-digit number starts with 0, as these are not valid 5-digit numbers. There are 4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24 ways to arrange the remaining 4 digits after placing 0 in the first position. So, there are 600 - 24 = 576 valid 5-digit numbers with a sum of digits divisible by 3.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of these 576 numbers that are divisible by 3. Since the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, the number itself must also be divisible by 3. To find the number of ways to arrange the digits such that the resulting number is divisible by 3, we can use the property that a number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nLet's consider the possible remainders when dividing the sum of the digits by 3:\n\n1. If the sum of the digits has a remainder of 0 when divided by 3, then the number is divisible by 3. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining 3 digits after choosing the first two digits with remainders 0 and 1 (e.g., 1 and 4, 2 and 5, or 3 and 0). So, there are 6 ways for this case.\n\n2. If the sum of the digits has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, then the number is not divisible by 3. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining 3 digits after choosing the first two digits with remainders 1 and 2 (e.g., 1 and 5, 2 and 4, or 3 and 1). So, there are 6 ways for this case.\n\n3. If the sum of the digits has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, then the number is not divisible by 3. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining 3 digits after choosing the first two digits with remainders 2 and 0 (e.g., 2 and 0, 3 and 3, or 4 and 2). So, there are 6 ways for this case.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to form a 5-digit number divisible by 3 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition is 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 ways.\n\nHowever, we have counted the cases where the 5-digit number starts with 0, which are not valid 5-digit numbers. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining 3 digits after placing 0 in the first position and choosing the first two digits with remainders 0 and 1 (e.g., 1 and 4, 2 and 5, or 3 and 0). So, there are 18 - 6 = 12 valid 5-digit numbers divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways W to form a 5-digit number divisible by 3 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition is 12.

            "Response": "First, let's find the total number of ways to form an album without any restrictions. There are 14 songs in total (5 Rock + 6 Pop + 3 Jazz), so we can have an album with 1 song, 2 songs, ..., or 14 songs. For each case, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of songs and k is the number of songs in the album.\n\n1. Album with 1 song: C(14, 1) = 14\n2. Album with 2 songs: C(14, 2) = 91\n3. Album with 3 songs: C(14, 3) = 364\n4. Album with 4 songs: C(14, 4) = 1001\n5. Album with 5 songs: C(14, 5) = 2002\n6. Album with 6 songs: C(14, 6) = 3003\n7. Album with 7 songs: C(14, 7) = 3432\n8. Album with 8 songs: C(14, 8) = 3003\n9. Album with 9 songs: C(14, 9) = 2002\n10. Album with 10 songs: C(14, 10) = 1001\n11. Album with 11 songs: C(14, 11) = 364\n12. Album with 12 songs: C(14, 12) = 91\n13. Album with 13 songs: C(14, 13) = 14\n14. Album with 14 songs: C(14, 14) = 1\n\nNow, let's find the number of albums that do not meet the requirements (i.e., albums without any Rock song or without any Pop song).\n\n1. Albums without any Rock song: There are 9 songs left (6 Pop + 3 Jazz), so we can have an album with 1 to 9 songs. We can calculate the combinations as before:\n\n   1. Album with 1 song: C(9, 1) = 9\n   2. Album with 2 songs: C(9, 2) = 36\n   3. Album with 3 songs: C(9, 3) = 84\n   4. Album with 4 songs: C(9, 4) = 126\n   5. Album with 5 songs: C(9, 5) = 126\n   6. Album with 6 songs: C(9, 6) = 84\n   7. Album with 7 songs: C(9, 7) = 36\n   8. Album with 8 songs: C(9, 8) = 9\n   9. Album with 9 songs: C(9, 9) = 1\n\n2. Albums without any Pop song: There are 8 songs left (5 Rock + 3 Jazz), so we can have an album with 1 to 8 songs. We can calculate the combinations as before:\n\n   1. Album with 1 song: C(8, 1) = 8\n   2. Album with 2 songs: C(8, 2) = 28\n   3. Album with 3 songs: C(8, 3) = 56\n   4. Album with 4 songs: C(8, 4) = 70\n   5. Album with 5 songs: C(8, 5) = 56\n   6. Album with 6 songs: C(8, 6) = 28\n   7. Album with 7 songs: C(8, 7) = 8\n   8. Album with 8 songs: C(8, 8) = 1\n\nNow, we need to subtract the albums without any Rock song and without any Pop song from the total number of albums:\n\nTotal albums = 14 + 91 + 364 + 1001 + 2002 + 3003 + 3432 + 3003 + 2002 + 1001 + 364 + 91 + 14 + 1 = 16,384\n\nAlbums without Rock = 9 + 36 + 84 + 126 + 126 + 84 + 36 + 9 + 1 = 511\n\nAlbums without Pop = 8 + 28 + 56 + 70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 255\n\nWe have to add back the albums without both Rock and Pop songs because we subtracted them twice. However, there are no such albums, so we don't need to add anything.\n\nFinally, the number of different albums that meet the requirements is:\n\n16,384 (total albums) - 511 (albums without Rock) - 255 (albums without Pop) = 15,618\n\nHowever, this number is not in the given options.

Since we want the unit digit to be odd, it can be one of the following: 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.\n\nFor each hundred (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, and 500s), there will be the same number of integers with odd unit digits.

We can count the number of odd unit digits by counting every second number from 101 to 199.

In other words, the shortest path between two points is a straight line.\n\nLet A = (8, 0), B = (0, 12), and C = P. Then, we want to minimize the sum of the distances AC and BC. By the triangle inequality, this sum is greater than or equal to the distance AB. The distance AB is given by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nAB = sqrt((8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 12)^2) = sqrt(64 + 144) = sqrt(208) = 4 * sqrt(13)\n\nNow, we want to find the points P in set S that lie on the line segment AB.

The factors of 381 are 1, 3, 127, and 381. \n\nWe can eliminate 1 and 381 as possible values for x, since they would not result in the greatest number that satisfies the conditions. \n\nIf x = 3, then 1657 = ax + 6 would give a = 550, and 2037 = bx + 5 would give b = 677. However, this would mean that (b - a) = 127, which is not equal to 3.\n\nIf x = 127, then 1657 = ax + 6 would give a = 13, and 2037 = bx + 5 would give b = 16. In this case, (b - a) = 3, which is equal to 127 - 1.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number which on dividing 1657 and 2037 leaves remainders 6 and 5 respectively is 127. The answer is B) 127.",
