However, this doesn't seem to fit the pattern since the difference between 16 and 46 is 30, not 6.

Let's find the difference between the fourth and third numbers: 46 - X.\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the fifth and fourth numbers: 94 - 46 = 48.\n\nSince we're assuming a constant second difference, the difference between (X - 10) and 6 should be the same as the difference between 48 and (46 - X).\n\nLet's set up an equation: (X - 10) - 6 = 48 - (46 - X).\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: X - 16 = 48 - 46 + X.\n\nFurther simplification gives: X - 16 = 2 + X.\n\nSubtracting X from both sides, we get: -16 = 2 - X.\n\nAdding X to both sides and subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: X = 18.\n\nHowever, 18 is not in the given options.

            "Response": "Since square P is inscribed in circle Q, the diameter of circle Q is equal to the diagonal of square P.\n\nLet the side length of square P be s. The perimeter of P is 4s, so we have 4s = 40, which means s = 10.\n\nNow we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal of square P. Let d be the diagonal of P. Then we have:\n\nd^2 = s^2 + s^2\nd^2 = 10^2 + 10^2\nd^2 = 200\nd = \u221a200 = 10\u221a2\n\nSo the diameter of circle Q is 10\u221a2. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = \u03c0d, so the circumference of Q is:\n\nC = \u03c0(10\u221a2) = 10\u221a2\u03c0\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }10\\sqrt{2}\\pi}$.",
