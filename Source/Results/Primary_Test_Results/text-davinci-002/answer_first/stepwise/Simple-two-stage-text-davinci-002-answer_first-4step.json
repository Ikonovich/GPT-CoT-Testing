In this case, that would mean moving the 3 to the other side. We can do that by adding 6 * 6 * 1 to both sides. This doesn't change the value of the left side, but it does cancel out the 3 on the right side. So now we have:\n\nx * 9 - 6 * 6 * x = 0\n\nTo solve for x, we need to find a value that when multiplied by 9 and subtracted by 6 * 6 * 1 will equal 0. The only value that will work is 3.",

This states that for any real numbers a, b, and c, we have:\n\na(b + c) = ab + ac\n\nWe can use this to simplify the expression 3(8 + 1 * 5 + 6). First, we use the distributive property to distribute the 3 over the parentheses:\n\n3(8 + 1 * 5 + 6) = 3(8 + 5 + 6)\n\nNext, we use the distributive property again to distribute the 3 over the parentheses:\n\n3(8 + 5 + 6) = 3(13 + 6)\n\nFinally, we use the distributive property one last time to distribute the 3 over the parentheses:\n\n3(13 + 6) = 3(19)\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3(19) = 57.",

            "Response": "\n\nThe answer is 35.\n\nTo solve this equation, we use the Order of Operations. This means that we first solve any operations within parentheses, then we solve any exponents, then we solve any multiplication and division (from left to right), and finally we solve any addition and subtraction (from left to right).\n\nSo, first we solve the operations within the parentheses. We have 3 * 7, which equals 21. Then we subtract 5, which equals 16. So, the parentheses now equal 16.\n\nNext, we solve the exponents. We have 9^2, which equals 81.\n\nNext, we solve the multiplication and division from left to right. We have 8 * 3, which equals 24. Then we divide 81 by 24, which equals 3.4.\n\nFinally, we solve the addition and subtraction from left to right. We have 16 + 3.4, which equals 19.4. Then we subtract 7, which equals 12.4.\n\nSo, the answer to the equation is 35.",
