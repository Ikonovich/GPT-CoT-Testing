If Store A's average (arithmetic mean) monthly revenue for the three months was $2,000 greater than Store B's average monthly revenue, then Store B's revenue in the third month was how much greater than Store A's revenue?\nOptions:  A) $14,000 B) $40,000 C) $42,000 D) $46,000 E) $50,000  Provide the explanation followed by the answer.. ",
            "Response": "\n\nThe answer is C) $42,000. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up two equations and solve for the unknown, Store B's revenue in the third month. \n\nWe know that the arithmetic mean, or average, of Store A's revenues for the three months is $2,000 greater than the arithmetic mean of Store B's revenues for the three months. This can be represented by the equation: \n\n3(Store A's average revenue) - 3(Store B's average revenue) = 6000 \n\nWe also know that in the first month, Store A's revenues were $40,000 higher than Store B's revenues, and in the second month Store A's revenues were $6,000 higher than Store B's revenues. This can be represented by the equation: \n\nStore A's revenue in the first month + Store A's revenue in the second month + Store A's revenue in the third month = 3(Store A's average revenue) \n\nStore B's revenue in the first month + Store B's revenue in the second month + Store B's revenue in the third month = 3(Store B's average revenue) \n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution. We will substitute the equation for Store A's average revenue into the equation for Store B's revenue in the first month + Store B's revenue in the second month + Store B's revenue in the third month. \n\nStore A's revenue in the first month + Store A's revenue in the second month + Store A's revenue in the third month = 3(Store A's average revenue) \n\nStore A's revenue in the first month + Store A's revenue in the second month + Store A's revenue in the third month = 3(Store B's average revenue + 2000) \n\nWe can simplify this equation by subtracting 2000 from each side. \n\nStore A's revenue in the first month + Store A's revenue in the second month + Store A's revenue in the third month = 3(Store B's average revenue) + 6000 \n\nWe can simplify this equation further by subtracting Store A's revenue in the first month and Store A's revenue in the second month from each side. \n\nStore A's revenue in the third month = Store B's revenue in the first month + Store B's revenue in the second month - 6000 \n\nWe know that Store A's revenue in the first month was $40,000 higher than Store B's revenue, and Store A's revenue in the second month was $6,000 higher than Store B's revenue. We can substitute these values into the equation for Store A's revenue in the third month. \n\nStore A's revenue in the third month = Store B's revenue in the first month + Store B's revenue in the second month - 6000 \n\nStore A's revenue in the third month = (Store B's revenue in the first month + 40000) + (Store B's revenue in the second month + 6000) - 6000 \n\nStore A's revenue in the third month = Store B's revenue in the first month + Store B's revenue in the second month + 34000 \n\nWe can solve this equation for Store B's revenue in the third month. \n\nStore B's revenue in the third month = Store A's revenue in the third month - 34000 \n\nWe know that Store A's revenue in the third month was $42,000. We can substitute this value into the equation for Store B's revenue in the third month. \n\nStore B's revenue in the third month = 42000 - 34000 \n\nStore B's revenue in the third month = 8000 \n\nTherefore, Store B's revenue in the third month was $8000 greater than Store A's revenue.",

            "Response": "\n\nThe answer is C)9. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the percent change formula: \n\nPercent Change = ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) x 100\n\nIn this case, the Old Value is 12 and the New Value is 9. Therefore: \n\nPercent Change = ((9-12)/12) x 100\nPercent Change = (-3/12) x 100\nPercent Change = -25%\n\nSince we are looking for a 44% gain, we need to find a New Value that would give us a percent change of 44%. We can set up the equation as follows: \n\n44% = ((New Value - 12)/12) x 100\n\nSolving for New Value, we get: \n\nNew Value = ((44/100) x 12) + 12\nNew Value = 5.28 + 12\nNew Value = 17.28\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an orange, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which would be 18. Therefore, the man needs to sell the oranges at 18 a rupee to gain 44%.",

            "Response": "\n\nThe answer is B)0. \n\nThe equation p + 2 = (p + 2) can be rewritten as p + 2 = p(2 - (p + 2)). Since p is a real number, we can divide both sides of the equation by p to get 1 + 2/p = 2 - (p + 2)/p. We can then add (p + 2)/p to both sides of the equation to get (p + 2)/p + 1 + 2/p = 2 + (p + 2)/p. This simplifies to 2 + 3/p = 2 + 1/p, which further simplifies to 3/p = 1/p. Since p is a real number, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3/p to get 1 = 1/p^2. This equation has two solutions, p = 1 and p = -1.

We can solve for the speed:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nSpeed = (340 km/hr * 4 hours) / (2 3/4 hours)\n\nSpeed = 486.667 km/hr\n\nThe closest answer choice is 495 km/hr, so that is the correct answer.",

            "Response": "\n\nThe explanation is as follows:\n\nIn order to evaporate water from a solution, the solution must be heated. When a solution is heated, the water in the solution will evaporate, leaving behind the solute. The amount of water that must be evaporated will depend on the concentration of the solution.\n\nIn this case, the initial solution is a 3-percent sugar solution. This means that for every 100 grams of solution, 3 grams are sugar. In order to make a 3-percent solution, the concentration of sugar must be increased. This can be done by evaporating water from the solution.\n\nTo calculate the amount of water that must be evaporated, we need to know the concentration of the solution after evaporation. Since we want to make a 3-percent solution, we know that the concentration of sugar must be 3 grams per 100 grams of solution.\n\nNow we can calculate the amount of water that must be evaporated. We know that the initial solution is 50 liters, and we know that the concentration of sugar must be 3 grams per 100 grams of solution. This means that the amount of sugar in the solution must be 150 grams.\n\nSince we know the amount of sugar in the solution, we can calculate the amount of water that must be evaporated. We know that for every 100 grams of solution, there are 3 grams of sugar. This means that for every 3 grams of sugar, there are 100 grams of solution. Therefore, for 150 grams of sugar, there are 450 grams of solution.\n\nThis means that 450 grams of water must be evaporated from the solution to make a 3-percent solution. Since there are 1000 grams in a liter, this means that 0.45 liters of water must be evaporated from the solution.\n\nThe answer is 0.45 liters.",

            "Response": "\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of its four sides. In this case, the perimeter is 206, which means that the sum of the lengths of the four sides is 206. The length and width of the rectangle are related by the equation:\n\nlength * width = area\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for either length or width:\n\nlength = area / width\nwidth = area / length\n\nSince we know that the perimeter is 206, we can substitute that value for the sum of the lengths of the four sides:\n\nlength + length + width + width = 206\n2 * length + 2 * width = 206\n\nWe can solve this equation for either length or width. Let's solve for length:\n\n2 * length + 2 * width = 206\n2 * length = 206 - 2 * width\nlength = (206 - 2 * width) / 2\n\nNow that we have an equation for length in terms of width, we can substitute that equation into the equation for the perimeter:\n\nlength + length + width + width = 206\n(206 - 2 * width) / 2 + (206 - 2 * width) / 2 + width + width = 206\n(206 - 2 * width) / 2 + (206 - 2 * width) / 2 + 2 * width = 206\n(4 * width - 412) / 2 + 2 * width = 206\n(4 * width - 412) / 2 = 206 - 2 * width\n(4 * width - 412) / 2 = 4 * width - 824\n(4 * width - 412) / 2 = 4 * width - 412 - 412\n(4 * width - 412) / 2 = 2 * width - 412\n(4 * width - 412) / 2 = 2 * width - 206\n(4 * width - 206) / 2 = 2 * width - 206\n2 * width - 206 = 2 * width - 206\n2 * width - 206 = 0\n2 * width = 206\nwidth = 206 / 2\nwidth = 103\n\nNow that we know the width, we can substitute that value back into the equation for length:\n\nlength = (206 - 2 * width) / 2\nlength = (206 - 2 * 103) / 2\nlength = (206 - 206) / 2\nlength = 0 / 2\nlength = 0\n\nThe length of the rectangle is 0, which means that the rectangle is actually a line.
