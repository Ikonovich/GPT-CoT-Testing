This states that when we multiply a number by a sum, we can multiply each number in the sum by the number and then add the products together.\n\nFor example, if we wanted to multiply 3 by 11, we could do it like this:\n\n3 * 11 = 3 * (10 + 1)\n\n3 * 11 = (3 * 10) + (3 * 1)\n\n3 * 11 = 30 + 3\n\n3 * 11 = 33\n\nWe can use the same method to solve this problem. We can distributethe 5 over the addition sign:\n\n5 + 9 * 6 = (5 + 9) * 6\n\n5 + 9 * 6 = 14 * 6\n\n5 + 9 * 6 = 84",
