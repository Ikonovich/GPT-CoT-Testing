We can find the simple interest by subtracting the principal from the final amount:\n\nSI = 956 - 825 = 131\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula and solve for the rate:\n\n131 = (825 \u00d7 R \u00d7 3) / 100\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for R:\n\nR = (131 \u00d7 100) / (825 \u00d7 3)\nR = 13100 / 2475\nR = 5.3%\n\nNow that we have the original rate of interest, we can find the new rate by adding 4%:\n\nNew Rate = 5.3% + 4% = 9.3%\n\nNow we can use the simple interest formula again to find the new final amount with the increased rate:\n\nSI = (825 \u00d7 9.3% \u00d7 3) / 100\nSI = (825 \u00d7 0.093 \u00d7 3)\nSI = 229.725\n\nNew Final Amount = Principal + Simple Interest\nNew Final Amount = 825 + 229.725\nNew Final Amount = 1054.725\n\nSince the answer should be in the given options, we can round the result to the nearest option:\n\nNew Final Amount \u2248 Rs. 1055\n\nSo the answer is {C}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let x be the distance the person walks and y be the distance the person bikes. We know that x + y = 64 miles (total distance) and that the person has 8 hours to complete the journey.\n\nWe can use the formula time = distance / rate to find the time spent walking and biking. The time spent walking is x / 8 mph and the time spent biking is y / 16 mph. The total time spent is 8 hours, so we have:\n\nx / 8 + y / 16 = 8\n\nWe already know that x + y = 64, so we can solve for y:\n\ny = 64 - x\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y in the time equation:\n\nx / 8 + (64 - x) / 16 = 8\n\nTo solve for x, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 16 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n2x + (64 - x) = 128\n\nNow we can simplify and solve for x:\n\n2x + 64 - x = 128\nx = 128 - 64\nx = 64\n\nSo the person would need to walk 64 miles.

            "Reasoning": "First, let's find the total number of ways to seat the 3 persons in the 5 chairs. This can be done using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of chairs and r is the number of persons to be seated.\n\nTotal ways to seat the 3 persons = C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(2*1)) = 10.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways the couple can sit together. We can treat the couple as a single unit, so we have 4 units to place (the couple and the single person). We can place these 4 units in C(5, 4) ways.\n\nWays to seat the 4 units = C(5, 4) = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5! / (4!1!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(1)) = 5.\n\nHowever, we must also account for the fact that the couple can switch places within their unit. Since there are 2 people in the couple, there are 2! ways to arrange them within the unit.\n\nTotal ways the couple can sit together = 5 (ways to seat the units) * 2! (ways to arrange the couple within the unit) = 5 * 2 = 10.\n\nNow, we can find the number of ways the couple does not sit together by subtracting the number of ways they sit together from the total number of ways to seat the 3 persons:\n\nWays the couple does not sit together = Total ways to seat the 3 persons - Ways the couple sits together = 10 - 10 = 0.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that the couple does not sit together by dividing the number of ways they do not sit together by the total number of ways to seat the 3 persons:\n\nProbability = Ways the couple does not sit together / Total ways to seat the 3 persons = 0 / 10 = 0.\n\nThe given options do not include the correct answer, which is 0.",

To convert minutes to seconds, we multiply by 60:\n\n10 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 600 seconds\n\nNow, we can find the speed of the train in meters per second:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 10,000 meters / 600 seconds\nSpeed = 50/3 meters/second\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the train. The train takes 6 seconds to pass a telegraph post. We can use the speed of the train to find the length:\n\nLength = Speed * Time\nLength = (50/3 meters/second) * 6 seconds\n\nLength = 100 meters\n\nThe length of the train is 100 meters.

            "Reasoning": "Let's first convert the rental charges to dollars for easier calculations. The charge for the first 1/4 mile is $0.34, and the charge for every 1/5 mile after that is $0.06.\n\nThe man paid a total of $1.24 in rental charges. We can subtract the initial charge of $0.34 to find out how much he paid for the additional miles:\n\n$1.24 - $0.34 = $0.90\n\nNow, we can divide the remaining amount by the charge per 1/5 mile to find out how many 1/5 mile increments he drove:\n\n$0.90 / $0.06 = 15\n\nSince each increment is 1/5 mile, we can multiply the number of increments by 1/5 to find the total additional miles driven:\n\n15 * 1/5 = 3\n\nFinally, we add the initial 1/4 mile to the additional miles driven:\n\n1/4 + 3 = 3.25\n\nSo, the man drove a total of 3.25 miles.

",
            "Reasoning": "First, we need to find the relationship between the diesel consumption and the speed of the bus. We know that when the bus is traveling at 60 kmph, its consumption is 1 litre per hour. Since the consumption varies directly as the square of its speed, we can write the equation:\n\nConsumption = k * (Speed^2)\n\nWhere k is a constant. We can find the value of k by plugging in the given values:\n\n1 = k * (60^2)\n1 = k * 3600\nk = 1/3600\n\nNow we have the relationship between the consumption and the speed:\n\nConsumption = (1/3600) * (Speed^2)\n\nNext, we need to find the total cost of traveling 600 km. The cost consists of two parts: the cost of diesel and the other expenses. The cost of diesel is $60 per litre, and the other expenses are $60 per hour.\n\nLet's denote the speed of the bus as S kmph. Then, the time taken to cover 600 km is (600/S) hours. The diesel consumption per hour is (1/3600) * (S^2) litres. So, the total diesel consumption for the trip is:\n\nDiesel consumption = (1/3600) * (S^2) * (600/S) = (1/6) * S\n\nThe cost of diesel for the trip is:\n\nDiesel cost = (1/6) * S * $60 = $10 * S\n\nThe other expenses for the trip are:\n\nOther expenses = $60 * (600/S) = $36000/S\n\nThe total cost of the trip is the sum of the diesel cost and the other expenses:\n\nTotal cost = $10 * S + $36000/S\n\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to find the minimum value of this function. We can do this by taking the derivative of the total cost function with respect to S and setting it to zero:\n\nd(Total cost)/dS = 10 - 36000/S^2 = 0\n\nSolving for S, we get:\n\nS^2 = 36000/10\nS^2 = 3600\nS = 60 kmph\n\nSo, the minimum expenditure occurs when the bus travels at 60 kmph. Now we can find the minimum total cost:\n\nMinimum total cost = $10 * 60 + $36000/60 = $600 + $600 = $1200\n\nTherefore, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is ${1200}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The store purchased the turtleneck sweaters and marked up the cost by 20%. If the cost of the sweater is C, then the original retail price is 1.20C.\n\n2. During the New Year season, the store marked up the prices by 25% of the original retail price. So, the new price is 1.25 * 1.20C = 1.50C.\n\n3. In February, the store offered a discount of 15%. The discounted price is 0.85 * 1.50C = 1.275C.\n\nNow, we need to find the profit percentage on the items sold in February. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is 1.275C - C = 0.275C.\n\nTo find the profit percentage, we divide the profit by the cost price and multiply by 100:\n\nProfit percentage = (0.275C / C) * 100 = 27.5%\n\nSo, the profit on the items sold in February is 27.5%.

            "Reasoning": "Let's denote the volume taken from the first jar as x and the volume taken from the second jar as y. We know that x + y = 30, since the third jar has a total volume of 30 liters.\n\nThe milk to water ratio in the first jar is 5:4, so the amount of milk in the first jar is (5/9)x and the amount of water is (4/9)x. In the second jar, the milk to water ratio is 2:1, so the amount of milk is (2/3)y and the amount of water is (1/3)y.\n\nIn the third jar, we want the milk to water ratio to be 1:1. So, the amount of milk should be equal to the amount of water.\n\n(5/9)x + (2/3)y = (4/9)x + (1/3)y\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) x + y = 30\n2) (5/9)x + (2/3)y = (4/9)x + (1/3)y\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.",

For each of the remaining 4 positions, there are 5 choices for even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). However, we need to subtract the case where the first digit is 0, as it would not be a 5-digit integer.

So, we have 3 options for the first digit: 2, 3, or 4.\n\nCase 1: The first digit is 2.\nWe have 2, 3, 3, 4, 4 left. We can use 0 as the second digit, and we have 4 remaining digits to choose from for the third digit, 3 for the fourth, 2 for the fifth, and 1 for the last digit. So, there are 4! = 24 numbers in this case.\n\nCase 2: The first digit is 3.\nWe have 0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4 left. We can use 0 as the second digit, and we have 4 remaining digits to choose from for the third digit, 3 for the fourth, 2 for the fifth, and 1 for the last digit.

So, there are 4! = 24 numbers in this case.\n\nHowever, we have counted some numbers twice because they have two identical digits (2, 3, or 4). We need to subtract the duplicates.\n\nDuplicates:\n- Two 2's: There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining digits (3, 3, 4, 4).\n- Two 3's: There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining digits (2, 2, 4, 4).\n- Two 4's: There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the remaining digits (2, 2, 3, 3).\n\nSo, we have counted 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 duplicates.\n\nThe total number of distinct 6-digit numbers greater than 100,000 is 24 + 24 + 24 - 18 = 54.\n\nSince the answer should be placed in squiggly brackets, the final answer is {54}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's first find the rate at which pipes A and B fill the cistern. \n\nPipe A can fill the cistern in 10 minutes, so its rate is 1/10 of the cistern per minute.\nPipe B can fill the cistern in 15 minutes, so its rate is 1/15 of the cistern per minute.\n\nWhen both pipes are open, they fill the cistern at a combined rate of (1/10 + 1/15) per minute. \n\nLet x be the number of minutes the waste pipe was open. During this time, the cistern was being filled by pipes A and B and emptied by the waste pipe. After x minutes, the cistern was not full, so the person closed the waste pipe. Then, it took another 4 minutes for pipes A and B to fill the cistern completely.\n\nSo, in (x + 4) minutes, pipes A and B filled the cistern completely. The combined rate of pipes A and B is (1/10 + 1/15) per minute, so:\n\n(1/10 + 1/15) * (x + 4) = 1\n\nNow, let's find the rate at which the waste pipe empties the cistern. During the x minutes when the waste pipe was open, the net filling rate was:\n\n(1/10 + 1/15) - waste pipe rate = (x + 4 - 4) / (x + 4)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n(1/10 + 1/15) - waste pipe rate = x / (x + 4)\n\nNow we can solve for the waste pipe rate:\n\nwaste pipe rate = (1/10 + 1/15) - x / (x + 4)\n\nSubstitute the value of (1/10 + 1/15) back into the equation:\n\nwaste pipe rate = (1/6) - x / (x + 4)\n\nNow we need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. We can do this by plugging in the answer choices and checking which one works.\n\nA) 6: waste pipe rate = (1/6) - 6 / (6 + 4) = 0, which is not possible since the waste pipe must have a positive rate.\nB) 8: waste pipe rate = (1/6) - 8 / (8 + 4) = 1/6 - 2/3 = -1/6, which is also not possible since the waste pipe must have a positive rate.\nC) 7: waste pipe rate = (1/6) - 7 / (7 + 4) = 1/6 - 7/11 = 1/66, which is a positive rate.\n\nSo, the waste pipe can empty the cistern in 7 minutes when full.

Since they are again 40 miles apart, we can write the equation:\n\n1.5x + 1.5y = 40\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of y in terms of x.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can write y as:\n\ny = (40/1.5) - x\n\nNow, substitute this value of y in the second equation:\n\n1.5x + 1.5((40/1.5) - x) = 40\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n1.5x + 40 - 1.5x = 40\n\n0.5x = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nSince x cannot be 0 (Otto is driving at a constant speed), there must be an error in our calculations. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nWe made an error in setting up the second equation. Since they are driving away from each other, their combined speed is still x + y miles per hour. In 1.5 hours, they cover a distance of 40 miles, so the equation remains:\n\n1.5(x + y) = 40\n\nNow we have two identical equations:\n\n1.5(x + y) = 40\n\n1.5(x + y) = 40\n\nSince both equations are the same, we can solve for y in terms of x using just one equation:\n\n1.5(x + y) = 40\n\nDivide both sides by 1.5:\n\nx + y = 40/1.5\n\nx + y = 80/3\n\nNow, solve for y:\n\ny = (80/3) - x\n\nSo, in terms of x, Han drives at a speed of (80/3) - x miles per hour.\n\nThe answer is closest to option B) 53.33 - x.

If 3x is a multiple of 4, then x must be a multiple of 4/3, which is not an integer. Therefore, 3x cannot be a multiple of 4. Since 3x is not a multiple of 4, 3x + 2 cannot be a multiple of 4 either.

However, if we choose x = 5, then y = 3(5) + 2 = 17, which is not a multiple of 7 either. We can see that for any integer value of x, y will never be a multiple of 7.

We are given that G = B + 5.\n\nSince there are 60 students in the class, the total number of boys and girls in the class is (3x + B) + (2x + G) = 60.\n\nSubstituting the values of x, B, and G, we get:\n\n(3 * 5 + B) + (2 * 5 + B + 5) = 60\n(15 + B) + (10 + B + 5) = 60\n(15 + B) + (15 + B) = 60\n30 + 2B = 60\n\nNow, solving for B:\n\n2B = 60 - 30\n2B = 30\nB = 15\n\nNow, we can find the number of girls not participating in sports:\n\nG = B + 5\nG = 15 + 5\nG = 20\n\nSo, the total number of girls in the class is the sum of the girls participating in sports and the girls not participating in sports:\n\nTotal girls = 10 (participating) + 20 (not participating)\nTotal girls = 30\n\nTherefore, the answer is 30, which corresponds to option C.

The combination formula is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial.\n\nWe know that there are 5 chairs and the decorator needs to choose 4 chairs.

            "Reasoning": "Let the number of persons in building P be x and the number of persons in building Q be y.\n\nAccording to the first condition, if 15 persons are sent from P to Q, the number of persons in each building is the same. So, we can write the equation:\n\nx - 15 = y + 15\n\nAccording to the second condition, if 20 persons are sent from Q to P, the number of persons in P is double the number of persons in Q. So, we can write the equation:\n\nx + 20 = 2(y - 20)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n1) x - 15 = y + 15\n2) x + 20 = 2(y - 20)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.",

Therefore, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 16. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (4 \u00b1 \u221a((-4)^2 - 4(1)(16))) / 2(1)\nx = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 64)) / 2\n\nSince the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is negative, there are no real solutions for x. However, we made an error in our initial equation. The correct equation should be:\n\n(1/4)x^2 = x - 4\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction, we get:\n\nx^2 = 4x - 16\n\nRearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 16 = 0\n\nNow, we can try factoring the quadratic equation:\n\n(x - 8)(x + 2) = 0\n\nThe possible values for x are 8 and -2. Since we are looking for the total number of apes, which must be a positive integer, the correct answer is x = 8.\n\nSo, the total number of apes is 8. The final answer is:\n\n{8}",

            "Reasoning": "Let's denote the distance the man traveled during the 30 minutes and 20 seconds as D. The time difference between when the second blast occurred and when the man heard it is 20 seconds. Since the speed of sound is 330 m/s, we can calculate the distance the sound traveled during those 20 seconds:\n\nDistance_sound = Speed_sound * Time_difference\nDistance_sound = 330 m/s * 20 s\nDistance_sound = 6600 m\n\nNow, we can find the distance the man was from the site when he heard the second blast. Since he was moving away from the site, the distance he traveled (D) should be subtracted from the distance the sound traveled:\n\nDistance_man = Distance_sound - D\n\nWe also know that the man traveled at a constant speed, so we can express D as:\n\nD = Speed_man * Time_traveled\n\nThe time the man traveled is 30 minutes and 20 seconds, which is equivalent to 1820 seconds (30 * 60 + 20). We can now set up an equation to solve for the man's speed:\n\nDistance_sound = Speed_man * Time_traveled + D\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n6600 m = Speed_man * 1820 s + D\n\nNow we need to express D in terms of Speed_man:\n\nD = Speed_man * Time_traveled - Distance_sound\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation:\n\n6600 m = Speed_man * 1820 s + (Speed_man * 1820 s - 6600 m)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n6600 m = 2 * Speed_man * 1820 s - 6600 m\n\nAdding 6600 m to both sides:\n\n13200 m = 2 * Speed_man * 1820 s\n\nDividing both sides by 2 * 1820 s:\n\nSpeed_man = 13200 m / (2 * 1820 s)\nSpeed_man = 13200 m / 3640 s\nSpeed_man = 3.626 m/s\n\nNow that we have the man's speed, we can find the distance he traveled (D):\n\nD = Speed_man * Time_traveled\nD = 3.626 m/s * 1820 s\nD = 6600 m\n\nFinally, we can find the distance the man was from the site when he heard the second blast:\n\nDistance_man = Distance_sound - D\nDistance_man = 6600 m - 6600 m\nDistance_man = 0 m\n\nSince the man was 0 meters away from the site when he heard the second blast, none of the given options are correct.",

We know that:\n\nx + y = 441 (Total units)\n\nSince 4 out of every 7 units are rented, we can find the total number of rented units:\n\n(4/7) * 441 = 252 (Rented units)\n\nNow, let's consider the rented one-bedroom units. Since 1/5 of the one-bedroom units are rented, we can write:\n\nRented one-bedroom units = (1/5) * x\n\nAnd since there is a 6:1 ratio of rented two-bedroom units to rented one-bedroom units, we can write:\n\nRented two-bedroom units = 6 * rented one-bedroom units\n\nNow, we know that the total rented units are 252:\n\nRented one-bedroom units + rented two-bedroom units = 252\n\nSubstituting the expressions for rented one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, we get:\n\n(1/5) * x + 6 * (1/5) * x = 252\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n(7/5) * x = 252\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (5/7) * 252\nx = 180\n\nNow that we have the number of one-bedroom units, we can find the number of two-bedroom units:\n\ny = 441 - x\ny = 441 - 180\ny = 261\n\nNow, we know that there is a 6:1 ratio of rented two-bedroom units to rented one-bedroom units.

Since 50 is divisible by 6 (50 = 6 * 8 + 2), we can find the remainder of 3^50 mod 7 by finding the remainder of 3^(50 % 6) mod 7:\n\n3^(50 % 6) mod 7 = 3^2 mod 7 = 2\n\nSo the remainder of the division (3^50)/7 is 2.

            "Reasoning": "First, let's find the total number of government vehicles with license plates starting with 79. There are 4 digits in the license plate, and the first two are already given as 7 and 9. So, we have 2 more digits to fill, and each digit can be any number from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are 10 options for each of the remaining digits. This gives us a total of 10 * 10 = 100 different combinations for the digits.\n\nNow, let's consider the two letters at the end of the license plate. Since the vehicle is a government vehicle, the letters can only be A, B, or C. This gives us 3 options for each letter. So, there are 3 * 3 = 9 different combinations for the letters.\n\nMultiplying the combinations of digits and letters, we get the total number of government vehicles with license plates starting with 79: 100 * 9 = 900.\n\nNow, let's find out how many vehicles the police can inspect within three hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so three hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. If it takes the police 9 minutes to inspect each vehicle, they can inspect 180 / 9 = 20 vehicles within three hours.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours. The probability is the number of vehicles they can inspect (20) divided by the total number of government vehicles with license plates starting with 79 (900).

Since the median is 10 gallons, we know that B and Q are the middle values, so B = 10 gallons.\n\nThe average capacity of the four barrels is 8 gallons, so the total capacity is 4 * 8 = 32 gallons. Since B = 10 gallons and Q \u2264 R, we can write the total capacity as A + 10 + Q + R = 32 gallons.\n\nTo maximize the capacity of the smallest barrel Q, we need to minimize the capacities of A and R. Since A \u2264 B, the minimum value for A is 1 gallon (option A). In this case, the total capacity equation becomes 1 + 10 + Q + R = 32 gallons, which simplifies to Q + R = 21 gallons.\n\nSince Q \u2264 R, the minimum value for R is 10 gallons (equal to the median). In this case, the total capacity equation becomes Q + 10 = 21 gallons, which simplifies to Q = 11 gallons.\n\nHowever, 11 gallons is not among the given options. Therefore, we need to consider the next smallest value for A, which is 2 gallons (option B).

In this case, the total capacity equation becomes Q + 10 = 20 gallons, which simplifies to Q = 10 gallons.\n\nAgain, 10 gallons is not among the given options.

In this case, the total capacity equation becomes 3 + 10 + Q + R = 32 gallons, which simplifies to Q + R = 19 gallons.\n\nSince Q \u2264 R, the minimum value for R is still 10 gallons. In this case, the total capacity equation becomes Q + 10 = 19 gallons, which simplifies to Q = 9 gallons.\n\nHowever, 9 gallons is not among the given options. We need to consider the next smallest value for A, which is 4 gallons (option D). In this case, the total capacity equation becomes 4 + 10 + Q + R = 32 gallons, which simplifies to Q + R = 18 gallons.\n\nSince Q \u2264 R, the minimum value for R is still 10 gallons.

This means that when X finishes the race, Y has only run 80 meters. \n\nLet's find the ratio of their speeds:\nSpeed of X / Speed of Y = 100 / 80 = 5 / 4\n\nNow, in the second race, X starts 10 meters behind the starting line. So, X has to run 110 meters to finish the race, while Y still has to run 100 meters.\n\nLet's find the time it takes for X to finish the race:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime of X = 110 meters / (5 * Speed of Y)\nTime of Y = 100 meters / (4 * Speed of Y)\n\nSince both X and Y run at the same previous speed, we can equate the time it takes for both to finish the race:\n110 meters / (5 * Speed of Y) = 100 meters / (4 * Speed of Y)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n440 * Speed of Y = 500 * Speed of Y\n\nSubtracting 440 * Speed of Y from both sides, we get:\n60 * Speed of Y = 0\n\nThis is not possible, as Speed of Y cannot be zero.

            "Reasoning": "First, let's find the radius of the circle. We know that the area of the circle is (25/4)\u03c0, so we can use the formula for the area of a circle, A = \u03c0r^2, to find the radius:\n\n(25/4)\u03c0 = \u03c0r^2\n\nDivide both sides by \u03c0:\n\n25/4 = r^2\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nr = 5/2\n\nNow, let's find the midpoint of the chord PB. The midpoint formula is:\n\nMidpoint = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2)\n\nFor points P(-1, 0) and B(3, 3), the midpoint is:\n\nMidpoint = ((-1 + 3)/2, (0 + 3)/2) = (1, 1.5)\n\nLet the center of the circle be point C(x, y). Since the midpoint of the chord is equidistant from the endpoints of the chord and the center of the circle, we can use the distance formula to set up an equation:\n\nDistance from C to P = Distance from C to Midpoint\n\nThe distance formula is:\n\n\u221a((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\u221a((x + 1)^2 + (y - 0)^2) = \u221a((x - 1)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2)\n\nSquare both sides to get rid of the square roots:\n\n(x + 1)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\nx^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 3y + 2.25\n\nCancel out the x^2 and y^2 terms:\n\n2x + 1 = -2x + 1 - 3y + 2.25\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x = -3y + 1.25\n\nNow, we know that the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle is equal to the radius. So, we can use the distance formula again to find the distance from C(x, y) to P(-1, 0):\n\n\u221a((x + 1)^2 + (y - 0)^2) = 5/2\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 25/4\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 4x = -3y + 1.25\n2) (x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 25/4\n\nSolve for x in equation 1:\n\nx = (-3y + 1.25)/4\n\nSubstitute this expression for x in equation 2:\n\n((-3y + 1.25)/4 + 1)^2 + y^2 = 25/4\n\nSolve for y:\n\ny = 1\n\nSubstitute y back into the expression for x:\n\nx = (-3(1) + 1.25)/4\n\nx = 1.5\n\nSo, the coordinates of the center of the circle are (1.5, 1).

            "Reasoning": "First, let's convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s.\n\nSpeed in m/s = (54 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 15 m/s\n\nNow, let's find the length of the train. Since the train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of the train = Speed of the train * Time taken to pass the man\nLength of the train = 15 m/s * 20 s = 300 m\n\nNext, let's find the length of the platform. We know that the train passes the platform in 35 seconds. So, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of the train + Length of the platform = Speed of the train * Time taken to pass the platform\n300 m + Length of the platform = 15 m/s * 35 s\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of the platform:\n\nLength of the platform = (15 m/s * 35 s) - 300 m\nLength of the platform = 525 m - 300 m\nLength of the platform = 225 m\n\nSo, the correct answer is {B}.",

To maximize the median, which is r, we need to minimize the values of k and m. Since k < m < r, we can set k = 1 and m = 2. Now, the sum of r and s is 30 - (1 + 2) = 27. Since r < s, we can set r = 13 and s = 14. Therefore, the greatest possible value of the median is 13, which corresponds to option C. The final answer is {13}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's first find the number of ways to distribute the 5 cards among the 3 envelopes. We can use the stars and bars method for this. We have 5 cards (stars) and 2 dividers (bars) to separate the cards into 3 groups. So, we have a total of 7 positions to place the stars and bars.\n\nWe can choose 2 positions for the bars out of the 7 positions, which can be done in C(7, 2) ways, where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of choosing k items from n items. So, we have C(7, 2) = 21 ways to distribute the cards among the envelopes.\n\nNow, let's find the number of distinct sets of envelope numbers. Since the prime numbers on the cards are distinct, the products of the cards in each envelope will also be distinct. Therefore, each of the 21 ways of distributing the cards will result in a distinct set of envelope numbers.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the cases where all three envelopes have the same number (i.e., 1). This can only happen if all the cards are in one envelope and the other two envelopes are empty. There are 3 ways to do this (one for each envelope that contains all the cards).\n\nSo, the total number of distinct sets of envelope numbers is 21 - 3 = 18.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to order these 18 sets from lowest to highest. Since there are 3 envelopes, there are 3! = 6 ways to order the numbers in each set. Therefore, there are 18 * 6 = 108 ways to order the sets.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where two or more envelopes have the same number. We need to subtract these cases.\n\nIf two envelopes have the same number, there are C(3, 2) = 3 ways to choose which two envelopes have the same number. For each of these 3 cases, there are 2! = 2 ways to order the numbers in the set. So, there are 3 * 2 = 6 ways to order the sets with two envelopes having the same number.\n\nIf all three envelopes have the same number, there is only 1 way to order the set (since all the numbers are the same).\n\nSo, the total number of ways to order the sets without overcounting is 108 - 6 - 1 = 101.\n\nTherefore, there are 101 different K sets that can be produced by this process.

Let's do that now:\n\nMonth 1: A1 = 1000(1 + 0.10)^1 = 1000(1.10) = 1100\nMonth 2: A2 = 1000(1 + 0.10)^2 = 1000(1.21) = 1210\nMonth 3: A3 = 1000(1 + 0.10)^3 = 1000(1.331) = 1331\n\nTotal amount = A1 + A2 + A3 = 1100 + 1210 + 1331 = 3641\n\nNow, we can find the equal monthly payments:\n\nMonthly payment = Total amount / Number of months\nMonthly payment = 3641 / 3\nMonthly payment = 1213.666666\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, Louie has to pay $1214 each month. However, this is still not one of the options. We made another mistake in our calculations.\n\nWe should have used the formula for the present value of an annuity to find the equal monthly payments. The formula is:\n\nPVA = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]\n\nWhere:\nPVA = the present value of an annuity\nPMT = the equal monthly payment\nr = the monthly interest rate (decimal)\nn = the number of months\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for PMT:\n\nPMT = PVA / [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]\n\nIn this case, PVA = $1000, r = 0.10 (10% per month), and n = 3 (three months).\n\nPMT = 1000 / [(1 - (1 + 0.10)^(-3)) / 0.10]\nPMT = 1000 / [(1 - (1.10)^(-3)) / 0.10]\nPMT = 1000 / [(1 - 0.751315) / 0.10]\nPMT = 1000 / [0.248685 / 0.10]\nPMT = 1000 / 2.48685\nPMT = 402.107694\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, Louie has to pay $402 each month. So, the correct answer is:\n\n{C}",

However, we can check if any of the given options can be a valid remainder by multiplying the fraction 1683/20 by a suitable integer.\n\nOption A) 2: If the remainder is 2, then s = 1683t/20 + 2. However, this would mean that s/t = 1683/20 + 2/20 = 1685/20, which is not equal to 84.15.\n\nOption B) 4: If the remainder is 4, then s = 1683t/20 + 4. However, this would mean that s/t = 1683/20 + 4/20 = 1687/20, which is not equal to 84.15.\n\nOption C) 8: If the remainder is 8, then s = 1683t/20 + 8. However, this would mean that s/t = 1683/20 + 8/20 = 1691/20, which is not equal to 84.15.\n\nOption D) 20: If the remainder is 20, then s = 1683t/20 + 20. However, this would mean that s/t = 1683/20 + 20/20 = 1703/20, which is not equal to 84.15.\n\nOption E) 9: If the remainder is 9, then s = 1683t/20 + 9. In this case, s/t = 1683/20 + 9/20 = 1692/20 = 846/10 = 84.6, which is not equal to 84.15 but is the closest option to the given value.\n\nSince none of the given options result in a fraction equal to 84.15, we will choose the option that is closest to the given value.\n\nThe final answer is {E}.",

Since the train passes a man standing on the platform in 20 seconds, we can use the formula:\n\nLength of train = Speed \u00d7 Time\nLength of train = 15 m/s \u00d7 20 s = 300 m\n\nNext, let's find the time it takes for the train to pass the platform completely.

Then (5(0) + 1)(3(0) - 2) = (1)(-2) < 0, so the inequality is false for -1/5 < x < 2/3.\n\n3. x > 2/3: Choose x = 1. Then (5(1) + 1)(3(1) - 2) = (6)(1) > 0, so the inequality is true for x > 2/3.\n\nThus, the solution to the inequality is x < -1/5 and x > 2/3.

Then the combined work rate of the man and his son is (W/15) + S.\n\nSince the combined work rate is W/6, we can write the equation:\n\n(W/15) + S = W/6\n\nTo solve for S, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\n(1/15)W + S = (1/6)W\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n2W + 30S = 5W\n\nNow, we can solve for S:\n\n30S = 3W\n\nS = W/10\n\nSo, the son's work rate is W/10, which means he can complete the work in 10 days.\n\nThe final answer is {E}.",

            "Reasoning": "To find the probability Q, we need to determine the number of favorable arrangements and divide it by the total number of possible arrangements.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible arrangements of the letters in the word MEDITERRANEAN without any restrictions. There are 13 letters in the word, with the following repetitions: M (1), E (3), D (1), I (1), T (1), R (2), A (2), and N (2). \n\nThe total number of arrangements can be found using the formula:\n\nTotal arrangements = 13! / (1! * 3! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 2! * 2! * 2!)\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable arrangements, where the first letter is E and the last letter is R. We are left with 11 positions to fill with the remaining 11 letters: M (1), E (2), D (1), I (1), T (1), R (1), A (2), and N (2).\n\nFavorable arrangements = 11! / (1! * 2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 2! * 2!)\n\nThe probability Q is the ratio of favorable arrangements to total arrangements:\n\nQ = Favorable arrangements / Total arrangements\n\nCalculate the values and find the probability Q.",
