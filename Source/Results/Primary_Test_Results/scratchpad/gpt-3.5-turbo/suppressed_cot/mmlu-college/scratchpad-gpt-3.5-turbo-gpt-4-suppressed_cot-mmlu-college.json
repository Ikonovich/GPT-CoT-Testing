            "Reasoning": "We can start by finding the rate of change of the volume of water in the cone with respect to time. Let's call this rate dV/dt. \n\nWe know that the water is dripping out of the hole at a constant rate of 3 cm^3 per minute, so dV/dt = -3. \n\nNext, we need to find an expression for the volume of water in the cone in terms of its height. We know that the height of the cone is 2 cm and the radius is 1 cm, so the volume of the entire cone is:\n\nV = (\u03c0/3)*r^2*h = (\u03c0/3)*(1^2)*2 = (2/3)*\u03c0\n\nWhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone, the height of the water is 1.5 cm. We can use similar triangles to find the radius of the water level, which is 0.5 cm. \n\nThe volume of water in the cone is then:\n\nV = (\u03c0/3)*r^2*h = (\u03c0/3)*(0.5^2)*1.5 = (1/4)*\u03c0\n\nNow we can use the chain rule to find the rate of change of the height of the water with respect to time, dh/dt, when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone:\n\ndV/dt = dV/dh * dh/dt\n\n-3 = (\u03c0/4)*h * dh/dt\n\ndh/dt = -12/(\u03c0*h)\n\nWhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone, h = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1 cm. \n\nSo, substituting h = 1 into the expression we just found, we get:\n\ndh/dt = -12/(\u03c0*1) = {-12/\u03c0} \n\nTherefore, the rate of change of the height of the water when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone is {-12/\u03c0} cm/min.",
