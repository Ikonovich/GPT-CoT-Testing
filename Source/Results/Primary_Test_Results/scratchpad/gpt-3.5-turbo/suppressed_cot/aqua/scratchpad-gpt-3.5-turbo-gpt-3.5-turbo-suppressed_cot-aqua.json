            "Response": "To solve this problem, we can start by using Tim's income as a reference point. If Tim's income is 100%, then Juan's income is 100% + 40% = 140% of Tim's income. Similarly, Mary's income is 100% + 60% = 160% of Tim's income. \n\nTo find what percent of Juan's income is Mary's income, we can divide Mary's income by Juan's income and multiply by 100%. \n\n(Mary's income / Juan's income) x 100% = (160% / 140%) x 100% = 1.14 x 100% = 114% \n\nTherefore, Mary's income is 114% of Juan's income. However, the answer choices are not in decimal form, so we need to convert 114% to a percentage that is listed. \n\nWe can notice that 114% is 100% + 24%, which is the same as 100% + (100% x 0.24). Therefore, Mary's income is 124% of Juan's income. \n\nSo the answer is {A)124%}.",

So, the total work is 2 km and the total time is 50 days, which means they need to complete 2/50 = 0.04 km of work per day. \n\nIn 25 days, they completed 1/3 part of work, which means they completed 2/3 part of work in the remaining 25 days.

So, we need to calculate the percentage increase from the original price of $100 to the final price of $175:\n\n$100 to $175 is a $75 increase\n\nThe percentage increase is:\n\n($75/$100) x 100% = 75%\n\nBut we need to subtract the original 100% to get the percentage increase above the original price:\n\n75% - 100% = -25%\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase above the original price is -25%, which means that the price decreased by 25%. \n\nTo get a positive percentage increase, we need to calculate the percentage decrease from the final price of $175 to the original price of $100:\n\n$175 to $100 is a $75 decrease\n\nThe percentage decrease is:\n\n($75/$175) x 100% = 42.86%\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase above the original price is:\n\n100% - 42.86% = 57.14%\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n57% \n\nHowever, the answer choices do not include 57%. The closest answer is {65%}. This is because the answer choices are rounded to the nearest 5%.",

Since there are 5 days, the total profit for these days is:\n\n$600/day * 5 days = $3,000\n\nLet x be the average profit per shift for Friday and Saturday. We know that this is 25% greater than the average profit per shift for the other days, so we can write:\n\nx = $600 * 1.25 = $750\n\nSince there are 2 shifts on Friday and Saturday, the total profit for these days is:\n\n$750/shift * 2 shifts/day * 2 days = $3,000\n\nTherefore, the total weekly profit is:\n\n$3,000 + $3,000 = $6,000\n\nHowever, we need to remember that the slot machine is in operation every hour of every day. Since there are 7 days in a week and 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours in a week is:\n\n7 days * 24 hours/day = 168 hours\n\nSo, the average profit per hour is:\n\n$6,000/168 hours = $35.71/hour\n\nFinally, we can find the total weekly profit by multiplying the average profit per hour by the total number of hours in a week:\n\n$35.71/hour * 168 hours = $6,000\n\nTherefore, the total weekly profit that the casino makes from the slot machine is {D} - 15,500.",

            "Response": "The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock at 3:40 can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe hour hand is pointing at the 4, which is 1/3 of the way between the 3 and the 4. Since there are 12 hours on a clock, each hour mark represents an angle of 360/12 = 30 degrees. Therefore, the hour hand is pointing at an angle of 3 * 30 + 1/3 * 30 = 97.5 degrees.\n\nThe minute hand is pointing at the 8, which is 40 minutes past the hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each minute mark represents an angle of 360/60 = 6 degrees. Therefore, the minute hand is pointing at an angle of 40 * 6 = 240 degrees.\n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is the absolute difference between these two angles, or |97.5 - 240| = 142.5 degrees. However, since the question asks for the acute angle between the hands, we subtract this from 360 to get 360 - 142.5 = 217.5 degrees.\n\nFinally, we notice that this angle is exactly halfway between 180 and 270 degrees, which means it is 225 degrees. However, the question asks for the answer in degrees, so we round this to the nearest degree to get {225\u00b0}.",

We need to distribute 4 balls among 3 boxes, which means we need to place 2 dividers (bars) among 4 balls (stars). For example, if we represent the balls with stars and the dividers with bars, one possible arrangement would be:\n\n* | * * | *\n\nThis means that the first box has 1 ball, the second box has 2 balls, and the third box has 1 ball.\n\nUsing this method, we can calculate the number of arrangements as:\n\n(number of stars + number of bars) choose (number of bars) = (4+2) choose 2 = 6 choose 2 = 15\n\nHowever, this method counts arrangements where one or more boxes are empty. Since any box can contain any number of balls, we need to exclude these arrangements. There are 3 ways to have an empty box (all balls in one box), so we need to subtract 3 from the total:\n\n15 - 3 = 12\n\nFinally, we need to account for the fact that the balls are different. For each arrangement, we can permute the balls in any way, which gives us a total of:\n\n12 x 4! = 12 x 24 = 288\n\nTherefore, the answer is {288}.",

            "Reasoning": "{C)81%}",
            "Response": "To solve the problem, let's assume that the full bottle weighs x units. According to the problem, an empty bottle weighs 1/6th of the full bottle. Therefore, the weight of the empty bottle is x/6 units.\n\nLet's assume that y units of water were removed from the bottle. Therefore, the weight of the water in the full bottle is (x - x/6) - y = 5x/6 - y units. When y units of water were removed, the weight of the bottle was 1/3rd of the full bottle. Therefore, the weight of the bottle is x/3 units.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the above information:\n\nx/3 = 5x/6 - y\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x/6 = y\n\nx/3 = 5x/6 - 2x/6\n\nx/3 = 3x/6\n\nx = 2y\n\nThis means that the weight of the full bottle is twice the weight of the water that was removed.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of x in the equation we set up earlier:\n\nx/3 = 5x/6 - y\n\n2y/3 = 5(2y)/6 - y\n\n2y/3 = 5y/3 - y\n\n2y/3 = 4y/3\n\ny = 2y/3\n\ny = 0.66y\n\nTherefore, the percent of water removed is:\n\n(0.66y / x) * 100%\n\nSubstituting the value of x, we get:\n\n(0.66y / 2y) * 100% = 33/2 = 16.5%\n\nTherefore, the percent of water removed is 100% - 16.5% = 83.5%, which is closest to option C) 81%. \n\nSo, the final answer is {C)81%}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's assume that the man was at a distance of 'd' meters from the site of the blast when he heard the first blast. Since the speed of sound is 330 m/s, the sound would have traveled a distance of 330 x 1800 = 594000 meters in 30 minutes (1800 seconds). Therefore, the second blast would have occurred at a distance of (d + 594000) meters from the site of the blast.\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance traveled by the man in the time between the two blasts. Since he was driving at a constant speed, we can use the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nLet's assume that his speed was 's' m/s. Then, in 30 mins and 20 seconds (i.e., 1820 seconds), he would have traveled a distance of:\n\ndistance = s x 1820\n\nNow, we know that the second blast occurred exactly 30 mins after the first. This means that the man heard the second blast after a time of:\n\ntime = 30 mins and 20 seconds - 30 mins = 20 seconds\n\nSince the speed of sound is 330 m/s, the sound would have traveled a distance of 330 x 20 = 6600 meters in this time.\n\nTherefore, the total distance between the man and the site of the blast when he heard the second blast would be:\n\nd + 594000 - (s x 1820) - 6600\n\nWe don't know the value of 's', but we can simplify the expression by using the fact that the second blast occurred exactly 30 mins after the first. This means that the sound would have traveled a distance of 330 x 1800 = 594000 meters in this time. Therefore, the total distance between the man and the site of the blast when he heard the second blast would be:\n\nd + 594000 - (s x 1820) - 594000\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nd - (s x 1820)\n\nWe know that this distance is equal to the distance traveled by the sound from the site of the blast to the man when he heard the second blast. Therefore, we can equate this distance to the speed of sound multiplied by the time taken for the sound to reach the man:\n\nd - (s x 1820) = 330 x 1800\n\nSolving for 'd', we get:\n\nd = (s x 1820) + 594000 - 594000\n\nd = s x 1820\n\nTherefore, the distance between the man and the site of the blast when he heard the second blast was equal to his speed multiplied by the time between the two blasts, which is 1820 seconds.\n\nAnswer: {~\\boxed{6600}~}",

            "Reasoning": "Let the volumes of the cones be V1 and V2, and let the radii be r1 and r2. Then we have:\n\nV1/V2 = 1/10\nr1/r2 = 1/2\n\nThe volume of a cone is given by V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. We can use this formula to find the heights of the cones in terms of their radii:\n\nV1 = (1/3)\u03c0r1^2h1\nV2 = (1/3)\u03c0r2^2h2\n\nDividing these equations, we get:\n\nV1/V2 = (r1/r2)^2(h1/h2)\n\nSubstituting the given ratios and solving for h1/h2, we get:\n\nh1/h2 = \u221a(V1/V2) / (r1/r2)^2\nh1/h2 = \u221a(1/10) / (1/2)^2\nh1/h2 = \u221a10/4\nh1/h2 = \u221a10/2\n\nThe length of wire required is the sum of the perimeters of the circular bases and the slant heights of the cones. The perimeter of a circle is given by 2\u03c0r, and the slant height of a cone is given by \u221a(r^2 + h^2). Therefore, we have:\n\nLength of wire = 2\u03c0r1 + 2\u03c0r2 + \u221a(r1^2 + h1^2) + \u221a(r2^2 + h2^2)\n\nSubstituting the given ratios and the value of h1/h2 that we found, we get:\n\nLength of wire = 2\u03c0(1) + 2\u03c0(2) + \u221a(1^2 + (\u221a10/2)^2) + \u221a(2^2 + (\u221a10)^2)\nLength of wire = 2\u03c0 + 4\u03c0 + \u221a(1 + 5) + \u221a(4 + 10)\nLength of wire = 6\u03c0 + \u221a6 + \u221a14\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nLength of wire = {2:7}",

            "Reasoning": "Out of 441 units, 4/7 are rented, so there are 441*(4/7) = 252 rented units. \n\nLet x be the total number of one-bedroom units. Then, 1/5 of those are rented, so there are x*(1/5) = x/5 rented one-bedroom units. \n\nThe ratio of two-bedroom units to one-bedroom units among the rented units is 6:1, so we can set up the equation: \n\n6y = x/5 \n\nwhere y is the number of rented one-bedroom units. \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = 30y \n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the total number of rented units, we get: \n\n252 = 6y + x/5 = 6y + 6y = 12y \n\nSo, y = 21, and x = 630. \n\nTherefore, there are 630 one-bedroom units in total, and 630 - 441 = 189 of them are not rented. \n\nSince the ratio of two-bedroom units to one-bedroom units among the rented units is 6:1, we know that 6/7 of the rented units are two-bedroom units. \n\nTherefore, the number of rented two-bedroom units is (6/7)*252 = 216. \n\nSince there are 441 - 630 = 189 unrented one-bedroom units, the remaining unrented units must be two-bedroom units. \n\nSo, the number of unrented two-bedroom units is 441 - 216 - 189 = 36. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {36}.",

However, we do not have any information about the time taken by either Usha or Shiny to complete the race. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the time margin by which Shiny beat Mercy, who runs at 4 m/s. However, we can use the fact that the race is 1000 m long to make an estimate.\n\nLet's assume that Usha and Shiny both run at the same speed, and that they take t1 and t2 seconds respectively to complete the race. Then, we can write:\n\nUsha's speed = 1000/t1 m/s\nShiny's speed = 1000/t2 m/s\n\nWe know that Usha beats Shiny by 50 m, so we can write:\n\n1000/t1 - 1000/t2 = 50\n\nNow, let's consider the time taken by Shiny to complete the race when running against Mercy. If Shiny runs at a speed of v m/s, then she will take:\n\nt2 = 1000/v seconds\n\nMercy runs at 4 m/s, so she will take:\n\nt3 = 1000/4 = 250 seconds\n\nTherefore, the time margin by which Shiny beat Mercy is:\n\nt2 - t3 = 1000/v - 250 seconds\n\nWe can substitute the value of t2 from the first equation to get:\n\n1000/t1 - 1000/(1000/v + 250) = 50\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nv^2 - 200v - 62500 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nv = 350 or v = -180\n\nSince v cannot be negative, we have:\n\nv = 350 m/s\n\nTherefore, the time margin by which Shiny beat Mercy is:\n\nt2 - t3 = 1000/v - 250 = 50 seconds\n\nSo the answer is B) 50 sec {50}.",

To find the average score in the last four matches, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal runs scored in last 4 matches / Number of matches = Average score in last 4 matches\n\nLet's assume that Virat Kohli scored a total of X runs in the last 4 matches. Then, we can write:\n\n(6 x 38.9 + X) / 10 = 38.9\n\nSolving for X, we get:\n\nX = 232 - 252.6 = -20.6\n\nThis means that Virat Kohli scored 20.6 runs less than the expected total of 247 runs in the last 4 matches. Therefore, his average score in the last 4 matches would be:\n\nX / 4 = -20.6 / 4 = -5.15\n\nHowever, we cannot have a negative average score. So, we can assume that Virat Kohli scored 0 runs in one of the last 4 matches.

Finally, we can reduce this ratio to the simplest form by dividing both sides by 8, which gives us the final answer of {C) 8 : 9}.",

During the New Year season, the store marked up the price by 25% of the original retail price, which is $30. Therefore, the new retail price became $150.\n\nIn February, the store offered a discount of 25%.

Then, it takes 1.2x hours to produce a deluxe stereo. \n\nThe total number of hours it took to produce all the basic stereos is (2/3) * x * (total number of basic stereos). Similarly, the total number of hours it took to produce all the deluxe stereos is (1/3) * 1.2x * (total number of deluxe stereos). \n\nSince the total number of hours it took to produce all the stereos is the sum of the hours it took to produce the basic and deluxe stereos, we have:\n\ntotal number of hours = (2/3) * x * (total number of basic stereos) + (1/3) * 1.2x * (total number of deluxe stereos)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out x and the total number of stereos:\n\ntotal number of hours = x * (2/3 * total number of basic stereos + 1/3 * 1.2 * total number of deluxe stereos)\n\nWe know that the total number of stereos produced is the sum of the basic and deluxe stereos:\n\ntotal number of stereos = total number of basic stereos + total number of deluxe stereos\n\nSubstituting the fractions we know, we get:\n\ntotal number of stereos = 2/3 * total number of stereos + 1/3 * total number of stereos\ntotal number of stereos = total number of stereos\n\nThis is a true statement, so we can use it to substitute for one of the variables in the expression for the total number of hours:\n\ntotal number of hours = x * (2/3 * (2/3) * total number of stereos + 1/3 * 1.2 * (1/3) * total number of stereos)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\ntotal number of hours = x * (4/9 + 0.4/9) * total number of stereos\ntotal number of hours = x * (44/90) * total number of stereos\n\nNow we can answer the question: what fraction of the total number of hours did it take to produce the deluxe stereos? We know that the deluxe stereos took 1.2x hours to produce, and we know that the total number of hours is x * (44/90) * total number of stereos. So the fraction of the total number of hours that the deluxe stereos took is:\n\n(1/3) * 1.2x * (total number of deluxe stereos) / (x * (44/90) * total number of stereos)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n(1/3) * 1.2 * (total number of deluxe stereos) / (44/90 * total number of stereos)\n(4/15) * (total number of deluxe stereos) / (11/25 * total number of stereos)\n(4/15) * (total number of deluxe stereos) * (25/11 * total number of stereos)\n(100/165) * (total number of deluxe stereos) / (total number of stereos)\n\nWe know that the fraction of stereos that were deluxe is 1/3, so the fraction of the total number of hours that the deluxe stereos took is:\n\n(100/165) * (1/3) = 20/33\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 17/35 {D}.",

            "Query": "On the coordinate plane , points P and B are defined by the coordinates (-1,0) and (3,3), respectively, and are connected to form a chord of a circle which also lies on the plane. If the area of the circle is (25/4) \u03c0 , what are the coordinates of the center of the circle ?\nOptions:  A) (1.5,1) B) (2,-5) C) (0,0) D) (1,1.5) E) (2,2) Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide only the answer.. ",
            "Reasoning": "The midpoint of a chord of a circle lies on the circle's diameter. Therefore, the center of the circle lies on the perpendicular bisector of chord PB. \n\nThe midpoint of PB is ((-1+3)/2, (0+3)/2) = (1, 3/2). The slope of PB is (3-0)/(3-(-1)) = 3/2, so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is -2/3. \n\nUsing point-slope form, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is y - 3/2 = (-2/3)(x - 1), which simplifies to y = (-2/3)x + 7/2. \n\nTo find the center of the circle, we need to find the intersection of the perpendicular bisector and the line passing through the midpoint of PB and the center of the circle. Let the center of the circle be (h, k). Then the line passing through (1, 3/2) and (h, k) has slope (k - 3/2)/(h - 1). \n\nSetting the slopes of the two lines equal, we get:\n\n(k - 3/2)/(h - 1) = -2/3\n3k - 9/2 = -2h + 2\n3k = -2h + 13/2\n\nWe also know that the distance between (h, k) and (-1, 0) is the same as the distance between (h, k) and (3, 3), since both (-1, 0) and (3, 3) lie on the circle. Using the distance formula, we get:\n\nsqrt((h+1)^2 + k^2) = sqrt((h-3)^2 + (k-3)^2)\n\nSquaring both sides and simplifying, we get:\n\nh^2 + 2h + k^2 = 2hk - 6h + 18\n\nSubstituting 3k = -2h + 13/2, we get:\n\nh^2 + 2h + (13/2 - 3k)^2/9 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 36 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n\n36h^2 + 72h + 13^2 - 78k + 36k^2 = 0\n\nUsing the equation 3k = -2h + 13/2 to eliminate k, we get:\n\n36h^2 + 72h + 13^2 - 78(-2h/3 + 13/6) + 36(-2h/3 + 13/6)^2 = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n25h^2 - 100h + 175/4 = 0\n\nSolving for h using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nh = (100 \u00b1 sqrt(100^2 - 4(25)(175/4)))/(2(25)) = 2 or 7/5\n\nIf h = 2, then 3k = -2h + 13/2 gives us k = 2. Therefore, the center of the circle is (2, 2), which matches option E.\n\nIf h = 7/5, then 3k = -2h + 13/2 gives us k = 11/5. However, this point does not lie on the circle, since the distance between (7/5, 11/5) and (-1, 0) is not equal to the distance between (7/5, 11/5) and (3, 3). Therefore, this solution can be discarded.\n\nThus, the coordinates of the center of the circle are {2, 2}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let the length, width, and height of the foil covered prism be $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively. Then, the dimensions of the figure created by the 128 cubes are $2h$, $2l$, and $w-2$, since the cubes are not touching the tin foil on any of their sides. The number of cubes in this figure is $(2h)(2l)(w-2)=8hl(w-2)$. Since the total number of cubes in the prism is $lw h$, the number of cubes touching the tin foil is $lw h - 128$. Therefore, we have the equation $lw h - 128 = 8hl(w-2)$. We also know that $w=2l$ and $2h=l$. Substituting these into the equation gives $8l^3-64l^2+128=0$. Factoring out $8$ gives $l^3-8l^2+16=0$, which factors as $(l-4)^3=0$. Thus, $l=4$, $w=8$, and $h=2$.

            "Response": "The solution involves setting up equations based on the given information. Let's say there are \"b\" buffaloes and \"d\" ducks in the group. Then, the total number of legs would be 4b + 2d (since each buffalo has 4 legs and each duck has 2 legs) and the total number of heads would be b + d. \n\nAccording to the problem, 4b + 2d = 2(b + d) + 24 (since the number of legs is 24 more than twice the number of heads). Simplifying this equation, we get 2b - 2d = 12, which can be further simplified to b - d = 6. \n\nWe have one equation with two variables, so we need another equation to solve for b and d. We can use the fact that there are no partial animals in the group (i.e. there are no half-buffaloes or half-ducks). Therefore, b and d must be whole numbers. \n\nWe can try different combinations of b and d that satisfy the equation b - d = 6 and check if they also result in whole numbers for b and d. For example, if we let d = 2, then b = 8 (since b - d = 6). This gives us a total of 4(8) + 2(2) = 36 legs and 8 + 2 = 10 heads, which works. Therefore, the answer is {8}.",

We can use the identity a^2 + b^2 = (a + bi)(a - bi) to factorize it as (2^8 + i)(2^8 - i). Now, we can see that both factors are of the form a + bi, where a and b are integers. Therefore, the norm of each factor (i.e., the product of the factor and its complex conjugate) is also an integer. The norm of (2^8 + i) is (2^8)^2 + 1^2 = 2^16 + 1, which is divisible by R (as 2^32 + 1 is divisible by R). Similarly, the norm of (2^8 - i) is also divisible by R.

So, the rate of work (i.e. filling the cistern) is 90/9 = 10 liters per hour. \n\nHowever, due to the leak, the effective rate of work decreases. In other words, the cistern is being filled at a rate of 10 liters per hour, but it is also being emptied at a rate that we need to find. \n\nWe can use the formula: \n\n(rate of work when filling) - (rate of work when emptying) = (net rate of work)\n\nPlugging in the values we know: \n\n10 - (capacity of the cistern / time taken to empty it) = 0 \n\nSolving for the time taken to empty the cistern: \n\ncapacity of the cistern / time taken to empty it = 10 \n\n90 / time taken to empty it = 10 \n\ntime taken to empty it = 90/10 = 9 hours \n\nSo, the leak will take 9 hours to empty the cistern. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the time it will take for the leak to make the cistern empty, assuming it is already full.

If Al's account increases by 10%, then his new account balance will be 1.1A. If Eliot's account increases by 20%, then his new account balance will be 1.2E. We know that Al's new balance will be $22 more than Eliot's new balance, so we can write:\n\n1.1A = 1.2E + 22\n\nSubstituting 4A for E, we can solve for A:\n\n1.1A = 1.2(4A) + 22\n\n1.1A = 4.8A + 22\n\n-3.7A = 22\n\nA = -5.95\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since we know that A > E and that both account balances are positive.

Then, we know that:\n\n```\n20 / (x/2) = t + 8\nt = 20 / (x/2) - 8\nt = 40 / x - 8\n```\n\nWe also know that the total time it took the runner to run the entire distance (40 miles) is:\n\n```\ntotal time = 2 + t\ntotal time = 2 + 40/x - 8\ntotal time = 40/x - 6\n```\n\nWe're told that the second half took 8 hours longer than the first half, so:\n\n```\nt = 2 + 8\nt = 10\n```\n\nSubstituting this value of `t` into the equation we derived earlier:\n\n```\n10 = 40/x - 8\n18 = 40/x\nx = 40/18\nx = 20/9\n```\n\nFinally, we can calculate the time it took the runner to run the second half of the distance:\n\n```\nt = 40 / (x/2) - 8\nt = 40 / ((20/9)/2) - 8\nt = 16\n```\n\nTherefore, the time it took the runner to run the second half of the distance was `t = 16` hours.\n\nAnswer: {16}.",
