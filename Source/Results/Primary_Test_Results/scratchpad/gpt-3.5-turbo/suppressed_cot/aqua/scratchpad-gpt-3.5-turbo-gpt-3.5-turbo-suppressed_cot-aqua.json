            "Response": "To solve this problem, we can start by using Tim's income as a reference point. If Tim's income is 100%, then Juan's income is 100% + 40% = 140% of Tim's income. Similarly, Mary's income is 100% + 60% = 160% of Tim's income. \n\nTo find what percent of Juan's income is Mary's income, we can divide Mary's income by Juan's income and multiply by 100%. \n\n(Mary's income / Juan's income) x 100% = (160% / 140%) x 100% = 1.14 x 100% = 114% \n\nTherefore, Mary's income is 114% of Juan's income. However, the answer choices are not in decimal form, so we need to convert 114% to a percentage that is listed. \n\nWe can notice that 114% is 100% + 24%, which is the same as 100% + (100% x 0.24). Therefore, Mary's income is 124% of Juan's income. \n\nSo the answer is {A)124%}.",
