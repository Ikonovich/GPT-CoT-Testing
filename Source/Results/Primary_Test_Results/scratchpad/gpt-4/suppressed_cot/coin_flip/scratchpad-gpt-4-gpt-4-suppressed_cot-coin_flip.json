            "Reasoning": "Since Marquis, Kylie, and Sandra each flip the coin once, we need to determine the final state of the coin after these three flips.\n\n1. Marquis flips the coin: Heads -> Tails\n2. Kylie flips the coin: Tails -> Heads\n3. Sandra flips the coin: Heads -> Tails\n\nAfter these three flips, the coin is tails up.
