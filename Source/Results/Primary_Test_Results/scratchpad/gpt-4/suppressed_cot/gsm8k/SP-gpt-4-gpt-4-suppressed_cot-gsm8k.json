She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide only the answer.. ",
            "Reasoning": "First, we need to find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating breakfast and baking muffins.\n\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 eggs.\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day, so after using 7 eggs, she has 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs left.\n\nShe sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 per day.\n\nThe final answer should be placed in squiggly brackets: {18}.",
