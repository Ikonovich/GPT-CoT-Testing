Let's denote the distance walked by Friend P as x and the distance walked by Friend Q as (43 - x). When they pass each other, the sum of the distances they have walked will be equal to the total length of the trail:\n\nx + (43 - x) = 43\n\nNow, we can use the formula for distance, which is:\n\ndistance = rate * time\n\nFor Friend P:\n\nx = P * t\n\nFor Friend Q:\n\n43 - x = Q * t\n\nSince they start at the same time, the time (t) is the same for both friends.

Let's solve for t in the equation for Friend Q:\n\nt = (43 - x) / Q\n\nNow, substitute this value of t into the equation for Friend P:\n\nx = P * ((43 - x) / Q)\n\nSince P = 1.15 * Q, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nx = (1.15 * Q) * ((43 - x) / Q)\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 1.15 * (43 - x)\n\nx = 49.45 - 1.15x\n\n2.15x = 49.45\n\nx \u2248 23\n\nSo, Friend P will have walked approximately 23 kilometers when they pass each other.

We know that P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 2/5 and P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 2/7. So, we can find P(A' \u2229 B'):\n\nP(A' \u2229 B') = P(A') * P(B') = (2/5) * (2/7) = 4/35\n\nNow, we can find P(A \u222a B):\n\nP(A \u222a B) = 1 - P(A' \u2229 B') = 1 - 4/35 = 31/35\n\nNow, we can find P(A \u2229 B):\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u222a B) = (3/5) + (5/7) - (31/35) = 6/35\n\nNow, we can find P(C):\n\nP(C) = 1 - P(A \u2229 B) = 1 - 6/35 = 29/35\n\nNow, we can find the probability that at least 1 customer out of 8 bought both a bagel and a coffee:\n\n1 - P(C)^8 = 1 - (29/35)^8 \u2248 199/245\n\nSo, the answer is {D}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's denote the number of cats as C and the number of dogs as D. We know that C + D = 45.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of adopted pets, which means we want to maximize the number of adopted cats and adopted dogs. We are given that 1/5 of the cats and 1/4 of the dogs were adopted.\n\nLet's denote the number of adopted cats as A_C and the number of adopted dogs as A_D. We have:\n\nA_C = (1/5)C\nA_D = (1/4)D\n\nWe want to maximize A_C + A_D, which is the total number of adopted pets.\n\nSince C and D are integers, we want to find integer values for C and D that maximize A_C + A_D while still satisfying C + D = 45.\n\nLet's first consider the cats. To maximize the number of adopted cats, we want to maximize the value of C such that (1/5)C is an integer. The largest multiple of 5 less than 45 is 40, so we can set C = 40. This gives us A_C = (1/5)(40) = 8.\n\nNow, let's consider the dogs. Since C = 40, we have D = 45 - 40 = 5. This gives us A_D = (1/4)(5) = 1.25. However, A_D must be an integer, so we need to adjust the values of C and D.\n\nLet's decrease the number of cats by 5, so C = 35. This still gives us an integer value for A_C: (1/5)(35) = 7. Now, we have D = 45 - 35 = 10, which gives us A_D = (1/4)(10) = 2.5. Again, A_D is not an integer.\n\nLet's decrease the number of cats by another 5, so C = 30. This gives us A_C = (1/5)(30) = 6. Now, we have D = 45 - 30 = 15, which gives us A_D = (1/4)(15) = 3.75. A_D is still not an integer.\n\nFinally, let's decrease the number of cats by another 5, so C = 25. This gives us A_C = (1/5)(25) = 5. Now, we have D = 45 - 25 = 20, which gives us A_D = (1/4)(20) = 5. Both A_C and A_D are integers.\n\nSo, the greatest possible number of pets that could have been adopted is A_C + A_D = 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is {10}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's first find the rate at which pipes A and B fill the cistern. \n\nPipe A can fill the cistern in 10 minutes, so its rate is 1/10 of the cistern per minute.\nPipe B can fill the cistern in 15 minutes, so its rate is 1/15 of the cistern per minute.\n\nWhen both pipes are open, they fill the cistern at a combined rate of (1/10 + 1/15) per minute. \n\nLet x be the time in minutes that both pipes A and B were open together before the person realized the waste pipe was also open. During this time, the cistern was filled to (1/10 + 1/15)x.\n\nLet W be the rate at which the waste pipe empties the cistern. During the x minutes, the waste pipe emptied Wx of the cistern. So, the cistern was filled to (1/10 + 1/15)x - Wx after x minutes.\n\nAfter closing the waste pipe, it took another 4 minutes for the cistern to be full. During these 4 minutes, pipes A and B filled the remaining part of the cistern, which is (1/10 + 1/15) * 4.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n(1/10 + 1/15)x - Wx + (1/10 + 1/15) * 4 = 1\n\nNow we need to find the value of x. Since the cistern was full after 4 more minutes, we know that:\n\n(1/10 + 1/15) * 4 = 1 - (1/10 + 1/15)x + Wx\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = (1 - (1/10 + 1/15) * 4) / ((1/10 + 1/15) - W)\n\nNow we need to find the value of W. Since the cistern was full after 4 more minutes, we know that:\n\n1 = (1/10 + 1/15)x - Wx + (1/10 + 1/15) * 4\n\nSubstituting the value of x from the previous equation, we get:\n\n1 = (1/10 + 1/15)((1 - (1/10 + 1/15) * 4) / ((1/10 + 1/15) - W)) - W((1 - (1/10 + 1/15) * 4) / ((1/10 + 1/15) - W)) + (1/10 + 1/15) * 4\n\nSolving for W, we get:\n\nW = 1/20\n\nSo, the waste pipe can empty the cistern in 20 minutes when full.\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the waste pipe to empty the cistern when it is filling. Since the waste pipe empties the cistern at a rate of 1/20 per minute, and the combined rate of pipes A and B filling the cistern is (1/10 + 1/15) per minute, the net rate of filling the cistern when all three pipes are open is:\n\n(1/10 + 1/15) - 1/20\n\nLet t be the time it takes for the waste pipe to empty the cistern when all three pipes are open. Then:\n\nt * ((1/10 + 1/15) - 1/20) = 1\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = 1 / ((1/10 + 1/15) - 1/20)\n\nt = 20\n\nSo, the waste pipe can empty the cistern in 20 minutes when all three pipes are open.\n\nThe final answer is {20}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's denote the amount invested by Nandan as x and the time he invested as t. Since Krishan invested three times as much as Nandan and for double the time, Krishan invested 3x and for 2t.\n\nThe gain is proportional to the money invested and the time for which the money is invested. So, the ratio of their gains can be represented as:\n\nGain of Krishan / Gain of Nandan = (3x * 2t) / (x * t)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nGain of Krishan / Gain of Nandan = 6\n\nSince the total gain is Rs. 28,000, we can represent the gains of Krishan and Nandan as:\n\nGain of Krishan = 6 * Gain of Nandan\n\nNow, we can write the equation for the total gain:\n\nGain of Krishan + Gain of Nandan = 28000\n\nSubstituting the expression for Gain of Krishan from the previous equation, we get:\n\n6 * Gain of Nandan + Gain of Nandan = 28000\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n7 * Gain of Nandan = 28000\n\nNow, we can solve for the Gain of Nandan:\n\nGain of Nandan = 28000 / 7\n\nGain of Nandan = 4000\n\nSo, the earning of Nandan is Rs. 4000.

The next smallest prime number is 7:\n\n341 \u00f7 7 = 48.714...\n\nSince the result is not a whole number, 341 is not divisible by 7. The next smallest prime number is 11:\n\n341 \u00f7 11 = 31\n\nSince the result is a whole number, 341 is divisible by 11, and the other factor is 31, which is a prime number. So, the prime factors of 1023 are 3, 11, and 31.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest prime factor among the options given:\n\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 23\nD) 29\nE) 31\n\nComparing the prime factors of 1023 (3, 11, and 31) with the options given, we can see that the greatest prime factor of 2^10 - 1 is 31.\n\nSo, the final answer is {E}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's denote the speed of the train as V (in km/hr). Since both persons are walking in the same direction as the train, we need to consider the relative speed between the train and each person.\n\nFor the first person, the relative speed is (V - 4.5) km/hr. In 8.4 seconds, the train overtakes the first person. We can convert the time to hours by dividing by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour): 8.4 / 3600 = 0.002333 hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the train while overtaking the first person can be calculated as:\nDistance = Relative Speed * Time\nDistance = (V - 4.5) * 0.002333\n\nFor the second person, the relative speed is (V - 5.4) km/hr. In 8.5 seconds, the train overtakes the second person. Converting the time to hours: 8.5 / 3600 = 0.002361 hours.\n\nThe distance covered by the train while overtaking the second person can be calculated as:\nDistance = Relative Speed * Time\nDistance = (V - 5.4) * 0.002361\n\nSince the train travels the same distance to overtake both persons, we can set the two distance equations equal to each other:\n\n(V - 4.5) * 0.002333 = (V - 5.4) * 0.002361\n\nNow, we can solve for V:",

Since OAC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC:\n\nAC^2 = OC^2 - OA^2\nAC^2 = 20^2 - r^2\n\nSimilarly, in triangle OBC, we have OB = r and BC = 20. Using the Pythagorean theorem again, we can find OC:\n\nOC^2 = OB^2 + BC^2\nOC^2 = r^2 + 20^2\n\nNow, we can use the fact that AC and OC are perpendicular bisectors of the quarter circle. This means that AC = OC. We can set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n20^2 - r^2 = r^2 + 20^2\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n2r^2 = 20^2\nr^2 = 10^2\nr = 10\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is E) None of these. The final answer is {E}.",

Therefore, k must have at least the factors 2, 3, and 5.\n\nSince k^3 must be divisible by 120, we need to find the smallest exponent for each prime factor in k that would satisfy this condition.

            "Reasoning": "To find the least square number that is exactly divisible by 10, 12, 15, and 18, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers and then find the smallest square number that is a multiple of the LCM.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factors of each number:\n10 = 2 * 5\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n15 = 3 * 5\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n\nNow, let's find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor:\nLCM = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest square number that is a multiple of 180. To do this, we need to make sure that each prime factor in the LCM has an even exponent. Currently, the exponent of 5 is odd (1), so we need to multiply the LCM by 5 to make the exponent even:\n\n180 * 5 = 900\n\nNow, the prime factorization of 900 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2, which is a square number. Therefore, the least square number that is exactly divisible by 10, 12, 15, and 18 is 900.\n\nThe final answer is {A}.",

            "Reasoning": "Let's denote the total amount of money George has as M. The cost of one orange is M/50, and the cost of one mango is M/40.\n\nGeorge retains 15% of the money for taxi fare, so he has 85% of the money left for buying fruits. This is equal to 0.85M.\n\nHe buys 15 mangoes, which costs 15 * (M/40) = (15M)/40.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying the mangoes. This is equal to 0.85M - (15M)/40.\n\nTo find out how many oranges he can buy with the remaining money, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of one orange:\n\n(0.85M - (15M)/40) / (M/50)\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\n\n(0.85M - (15M)/40) * (50/M)\n\n(0.85 * 50 - 15 * 50/40)\n\n(42.5 - 18.75)\n\n23.75\n\nSince George can only buy whole oranges, he can buy 23 oranges. However, this is not one of the options given. Let's check the closest options to see if there might have been a rounding error.\n\nOption A) 25 oranges would cost 25 * (M/50) = M/2. If George spent M/2 on oranges, he would have M/2 left for taxi fare and mangoes. Since he retains 15% of the money for taxi fare, he would have 35% of the money left for mangoes.

            "Reasoning": "First, let's find the interest Manoj paid to Anwar for borrowing Rs. 4200 at 6% p.a. simple interest for three years.\n\nSimple Interest = (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time) / 100\nInterest paid to Anwar = (4200 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3) / 100 = Rs. 756\n\nNow, let's denote the additional amount Manoj added to the borrowed sum as x. So, the total amount lent to Ramu is (4200 + x).\n\nManoj gains Rs. 824.85 from the whole transaction, which means the interest he received from Ramu minus the interest he paid to Anwar is equal to Rs. 824.85.\n\nInterest received from Ramu = (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time) / 100\nInterest received from Ramu = ((4200 + x) \u00d7 9 \u00d7 3) / 100\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n\nInterest received from Ramu - Interest paid to Anwar = 824.85\n((4200 + x) \u00d7 9 \u00d7 3) / 100 - 756 = 824.85\n\nSolving for x:\n\n(37800 + 27x) / 100 - 756 = 824.85\n37800 + 27x - 75600 = 82485\n27x = 44785\nx = 1660\n\nSo, the additional amount Manoj added to the borrowed sum is Rs. 1660.

There are 2 possible arrangements: Male-Female-Male-Female or Female-Male-Female-Male.\n\nFor the first arrangement (Male-Female-Male-Female), there are 2! ways to arrange the males and 2! ways to arrange the females. So, there are 2! * 2! = 4 ways for this arrangement.\n\nFor the second arrangement (Female-Male-Female-Male), there is only 1 female left, so there is only 1 way to arrange the females.

This is not possible, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: x+9 < 0\nIn this case, |x+9| = -(x+9). So, the inequality becomes -(x+9) < x, which simplifies to -x-9 < x. Adding x to both sides, we get -9 < 2x. Dividing by 2, we get -4.5 < x. Since x is a positive integer, the smallest value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 1. The next value is x = 2.

So, X has to cover 110 meters while Y has to cover 100 meters.\n\nLet's assume that the time taken by X to complete the second race is t seconds. Then, the time taken by Y to complete the second race will also be t seconds (since they both finish the race at the same time).\n\nUsing the speed ratio, we can write the equation:\n(5/4) * Distance covered by Y = Distance covered by X\n(5/4) * 100 = 110\n500 = 440\n60 = 4 * Distance covered by X - Distance covered by Y\n\nNow, let's find the difference in distance covered by X and Y in the second race:\nDistance covered by X - Distance covered by Y = 60 / 4 = 15 meters\n\nSince X started 10 meters behind the starting line, the actual difference in distance covered in the second race is:\n15 - 10 = 5 meters\n\nSo, X beats Y by 5 meters in the second race. However, this option is not available in the given choices. It seems there might be an error in the options provided. Please double-check the options and let me know if there's any change.",

Let y be the number of passengers with round-trip tickets. Then, 0.8y passengers had round-trip tickets but did not take their cars.\n\nSince 20% of the passengers held round-trip tickets and also took their cars abroad the ship, this means that the remaining passengers with round-trip tickets (0.8y) did not take their cars. So, we can write the equation:\n\n0.2x = 0.8y\n\nNow, we want to find the percentage of passengers with round-trip tickets, which is y/x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.2x:\n\n(0.2x) / (0.2x) = (0.8y) / (0.2x)\n\n1 = 4y/x\n\nSince we want to find y/x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n4 = y/x\n\nSo, y/x = 4, which means that 4 times the number of passengers with round-trip tickets and cars is equal to the total number of passengers.

We can write the sequence as:\n\n1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, ...\n\nNow, let's find the average of the first 200 terms. To do this, we need to find the sum of the first 200 terms and then divide by 200.\n\nThe first 200 terms can be divided into two groups: positive numbers and negative numbers. There are 100 positive numbers and 100 negative numbers in the first 200 terms.\n\nThe sum of the first 100 positive numbers is:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 199\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. We can find the sum using the formula:\n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.\n\nSum = (100 * (1 + 199)) / 2\nSum = (100 * 200) / 2\nSum = 10000\n\nThe sum of the first 100 negative numbers is:\n\n-2 + (-4) + (-6) + ... + (-200)\n\nThis is also an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. We can find the sum using the same formula:\n\nSum = (n * (a1 + an)) / 2\n\nSum = (100 * (-2 + (-200))) / 2\nSum = (100 * (-202)) / 2\nSum = -10100\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the first 200 terms:\n\nTotal sum = 10000 + (-10100)\nTotal sum = -100\n\nFinally, let's find the average of the first 200 terms:\n\nAverage = Total sum / 200\nAverage = -100 / 200\nAverage = -1/2\n\nSo, the average of the first 200 terms of the sequence is -1/2.

So, F could be 3.\n\nIf F = 4, the minimum value for the left side of the equation is 400, which is already greater than 366. So, F cannot be 4 or greater.\n\nNow we know that F = 3. Let's substitute this value into the equation:\n\n100(3) + 10O + G = 366.\n\n300 + 10O + G = 366.\n\nNow, let's solve for O and G:\n\n10O + G = 66.\n\nThe only possible value for O that satisfies this equation is 6, which gives us G = 6 as well.\n\nSo, F = 3, O = 6, and G = 6.

Now we can find y using equation 2:\n\ny = 16 - z\ny = 16 - 9\ny = 7\n\nSo, Yukou needs to buy 7 more monster books and 9 more space travel books to maintain the 4:5 ratio and reach his goal of 52 books.\n\nThe correct answer is {E)7 monster, 12 space}.",

We have 5 cards (stars) and we want to divide them into 3 groups (envelopes). We need 2 bars to divide the cards into 3 groups. So, we have a total of 5 stars and 2 bars, which is 7 items. We need to choose 2 positions for the bars among these 7 items. This can be done in C(7, 2) ways, which is 21 ways.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where an envelope has no cards. There are 3 ways to choose which envelope will be empty. In this case, we have 5 cards to distribute among the remaining 2 envelopes. Using the stars and bars method again, we have 5 stars and 1 bar, which is 6 items. We need to choose 1 position for the bar among these 6 items. This can be done in C(6, 1) ways, which is 6 ways. However, we have counted the case where all 5 cards are in one envelope three times (once for each envelope), so we need to subtract 2 from the total to avoid overcounting. So, there are 3 * (6 - 2) = 12 ways to distribute the cards when one envelope is empty.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to distribute the cards is 21 - 12 = 9 ways when no envelope is empty.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of different K sets that can be produced. Since there are 9 ways to distribute the cards when no envelope is empty, there are 9 different K sets in this case.

Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nP - Q = (P + Q) / 2\n\nNow, we need to find the value of Q/P. To do this, let's first solve for P in terms of Q:\n\n2(P - Q) = P + Q\n2P - 2Q = P + Q\nP = 3Q\n\nNow, we can find the value of Q/P:\n\nQ/P = Q / (3Q) = 1/3\n\nSo, the value of Q/P is 1/3, which corresponds to option D.

            "Reasoning": "To form a five-digit number without repetition using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, we need to consider the divisibility rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the given digits: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can form a number divisible by 3 using these digits.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. The five-digit number starts with 0. In this case, we have 4 remaining digits (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) to form a four-digit number divisible by 3. The sum of these digits is 15, which is divisible by 3. There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange these digits, which is 4! = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24 ways.\n\n2. The five-digit number does not start with 0. In this case, we have 5 remaining digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) to form a five-digit number divisible by 3. Since the sum of these digits is 15, we can form a number divisible by 3 using these digits. However, we need to subtract the number of ways where the last digit is 0, as this would result in a four-digit number.\n\nThere are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange the digits without restrictions, which is 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120 ways. To find the number of ways where the last digit is 0, we can treat the remaining 4 digits (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) as a four-digit number divisible by 3. As calculated in case 1, there are 24 ways to do this.\n\nSo, the number of ways to form a five-digit number divisible by 3 without starting with 0 is 120 - 24 = 96 ways.\n\nAdding the number of ways from both cases, we get W = 24 + 96 = 120 ways.\n\nThe correct answer is B) 210.

            "Reasoning": "To find the probability Q, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes (arrangements with E as the first letter and R as the last letter) and divide it by the total number of possible arrangements of the letters in the word MEDITERRANEAN.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible arrangements. The word MEDITERRANEAN has 13 letters, with the following frequency of each letter:\n- M: 1\n- E: 4\n- D: 1\n- I: 1\n- T: 1\n- R: 2\n- A: 2\n- N: 1\n\nThe total number of arrangements can be found using the formula for permutations of a multiset: n!/(n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of elements and n1, n2, ..., nk are the frequencies of each element.\n\nTotal arrangements = 13!/(1! * 4! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 2! * 2! * 1!) = 13!/(4! * 2! * 2!)\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable outcomes. Since the first letter must be E and the last letter must be R, we are left with 11 positions to arrange the remaining letters. The frequency of each letter in the remaining set is:\n- M: 1\n- E: 3\n- D: 1\n- I: 1\n- T: 1\n- R: 1\n- A: 2\n- N: 1\n\nFavorable outcomes = 11!/(1! * 3! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 2! * 1!) = 11!/(3! * 2!)\n\nFinally, we can find the probability Q by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of arrangements:\n\nQ = (11!/(3! * 2!)) / (13!/(4! * 2! * 2!))\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nQ = (11! * 4! * 2! * 2!) / (13! * 3! * 2!)\n\nQ = (4 * 3 * 2) / (13 * 12 * 11)\n\nQ = 1/65\n\nThe closest answer to 1/65 is 1/50, so the final answer is:\n\n{D}",
