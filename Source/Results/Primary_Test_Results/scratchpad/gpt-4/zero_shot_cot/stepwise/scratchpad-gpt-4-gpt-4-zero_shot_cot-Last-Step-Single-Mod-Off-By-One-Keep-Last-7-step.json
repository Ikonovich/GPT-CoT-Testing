There are no parentheses/brackets or exponents/orders in the expression.\n2. We have two multiplication operations: 1 * 3 and 3 * 9. Let's calculate them:\n   1 * 3 = 3\n   3 * 9 = 27\n3. Now, we can rewrite the expression with the results of the multiplication operations:\n   7 + 6 + 3 * 27 + 5 - 3 + 6\n4. Next, we perform the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:\n   7 + 6 = 13\n   13 + 27 = 40\n   40 + 5 = 45\n   45 - 3 = 42\n   42 + 6 = 48\n\nSo, the final answer is {48}.",
