        "Response": "We can use the formula:\n\nP(at least one coffee and bagel) = 1 - P(no coffee and bagel)\n\nTo find P(no coffee and bagel), we need to use the information given about the number of customers who bought each item. Let's represent the number of customers who bought both as \"x\". Then we have:\n\nNumber of customers who bought a bagel = 3 + x\nNumber of customers who bought a coffee = 5 + x\n\nWe know that some customers bought both, so we can set up the equation:\n\n3 + x + 5 + x = total number of customers\n8 + 2x = total number of customers\n\nWe can solve for x by subtracting 8 from both sides and dividing by 2:\n\nx = (total number of customers - 8) / 2\n\nNow we can use this information to find P(no coffee and bagel). The number of customers who didn't buy a bagel is:\n\ntotal number of customers - (3 + x) = (total number of customers - 8) / 2\n\nSimilarly, the number of customers who didn't buy a coffee is:\n\ntotal number of customers - (5 + x) = (total number of customers - 8) / 2\n\nTo find the number of customers who didn't buy either, we need to subtract the number who didn't buy a bagel from the total number who didn't buy a coffee:\n\n(total number of customers - 8) / 2 - (total number of customers - 8) / 2^2\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n(total number of customers - 8) / 4\n\nSo, P(no coffee and bagel) is:\n\n[(total number of customers - 8) / 4] / total number of customers\n\nNow we can plug in the value for total number of customers, which is 8, and simplify:\n\nP(no coffee and bagel) = [(8 - 8) / 4] / 8 = 0\n\nTherefore, P(at least one coffee and bagel) = 1 - 0 = 1.

If both mice survive after 14 hours, we know that the poisoned can is in the remaining 7 cans. We repeat the process again by dividing the remaining 7 cans into two groups of 3 and 4 cans each and give a small amount of the contents of each group to one mouse each. If both mice survive after 14 hours, we know that the poisoned can is in the remaining 3 cans.

        "Response": "Let's assume that the field has a total of 12 units of work to be done (this is just an arbitrary number for the sake of calculation). \n\nIf 3 men can reap the field in 10 days, then 1 man can reap 4 units of work in 10 days (since 3 men together can reap 12 units of work in 10 days). Similarly, if 4 women can reap the field in 10 days, then 1 woman can reap 3 units of work in 10 days. \n\nNow, let's calculate how much work 5 men and 6 women can do in 1 day: \n\n5 men can do 5 x 4 = 20 units of work in 10 days, which means they can do 2 units of work in 1 day. \n\nSimilarly, 6 women can do 6 x 3 = 18 units of work in 10 days, which means they can do 1.8 units of work in 1 day. \n\nTogether, 5 men and 6 women can do 2 + 1.8 = 3.8 units of work in 1 day. \n\nTherefore, to complete the 12 units of work in the field, they will need 12/3.8 = 3.157 days. \n\nRounding off to the nearest hundredth, the answer is {3.16}, which is not one of the options given.

If we add 20 to the number of pets still in the shelter on Friday, we get: \n\n45 (original number) - 9 (adopted cats) - 11 (adopted dogs) + 20 (adopted pets) = 45 - 9 - 11 + 20 = 45 - 0.2(45) = 36 \n\nSo there would be 36 pets left in the shelter on Friday, which is possible since no new pets were brought in during the week. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {20}.",

        "Response": "After 21 hours, tank B is 1/32 filled, which means it has (1-1/32) = 31/32 of its capacity left to be filled. \n\nWe know that in the first hour, tank B gets filled with 10 liters of water.

        "Response": "The pasture is rented for 10 months and A uses it for 7 months, so B will use it for the remaining 3 months. Let's assume that A pays $x for the rent of the pasture. Then B will pay half as much again as A, which means he will pay $x + (1/2)x = (3/2)x.\n\nNow, we know that A puts in 80 cows for 7 months. Let's calculate the total number of cow-months that A uses: 80 cows x 7 months = 560 cow-months.\n\nWe want to find out how many cows B can put in for the remaining 3 months. Let's call this number of cows y. Then, B will use y cows x 3 months = 3y cow-months.\n\nWe know that the total number of cow-months used by A and B cannot exceed the total number of months the pasture is rented for, which is 10 months. So, we can write an equation:\n\n560 cow-months + 3y cow-months \u2264 10 months\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3y \u2264 440\n\ny \u2264 440/3\n\ny \u2264 146.67\n\nSince y has to be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a cow), the maximum number of cows B can put in is 146.\n\nBut we also know that B has to pay (3/2)x for the rent, which is half as much again as A. We don't know the value of x, but we can still find the answer by using the fact that B pays half as much again as A. If A pays x, then B pays (3/2)x. We can write an equation:\n\n(3/2)x = 146 cows x 3 months\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx = 292/3\n\nx \u2248 97.33\n\nSo, A pays $97.33 for the rent of the pasture. B pays half as much again as A, which is (3/2)x = (3/2)($97.33) = $146. Here's the final answer:\n\nB can put in a maximum of 146 cows for the remaining 3 months, and he will pay $146 for the rent of the pasture. Therefore, the answer is {146, 146}.",

We also know that there are 5 chairs in the warehouse. \n\nSo we can plug in these values and solve for n: \n\n5C4 * nC4 = 75 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n5 * n! / 4!(n-4)! = 75 \n\nn! / 4!(n-4)! = 15 \n\nn(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) / 4*3*2*1 = 15 \n\nn(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) = 120 \n\nAt this point, we could try different values of n until we find one that works (starting with n=6, since we know there are at least 6 tables in the warehouse). However, there's a faster way to solve this equation using a bit of algebraic manipulation: \n\nn(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) = 120 \n\nn(n-1) = 120 / (n-2)(n-3) \n\nn^2 - n = 120 / (n^2 - 5n + 6) \n\nn^3 - 5n^2 + 6n = 120 \n\nn(n^2 - 5n + 6) = 120 \n\nn(n-2)(n-3) = 120 \n\nNow we can see that n=8 is a solution, since: \n\n8 * 6 * 5 = 240 \n\nAnd we only need to select 4 of those tables, which gives us the required 75 combinations. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {B) 8}.",

        "Response": "We can factor $2^{10}-1$ using the difference of squares formula: $$2^{10}-1=(2^5+1)(2^5-1).$$ We can then factor $2^5-1$ using the difference of cubes formula: $$2^5-1=(2-1)(2^4+2^3+2^2+2+1)=(2^4+2^3+2^2+2+1).$$ Therefore, we have $$2^{10}-1=(2^5+1)(2^4+2^3+2^2+2+1).$$ We can see that $2^5+1$ is not divisible by any of the answer choices, so we focus on $2^4+2^3+2^2+2+1$. We can factor out a $2^2$ to get $$2^4+2^3+2^2+2+1=2^2(2^2+2+1)+2+1.$$ We recognize that $2^2+2+1$ is equal to $7$, which is prime.

        "Response": "We can approach this problem by using complementary counting. First, we count the total number of outcomes, which is simply the number of ways to award the prizes to the 6 teams, without any restrictions. This is a classic example of a permutations problem, and the number of outcomes is 6! = 720.\n\nNext, we count the number of outcomes where neither Team A nor Team B wins a prize. There are 4 prizes remaining to be awarded to 4 teams out of the 6 remaining teams (excluding Team A and Team B). This is again a permutations problem, and the number of outcomes is 4! = 24.\n\nTherefore, the number of outcomes where either Team A or Team B wins a prize is 720 - 24 = 696.\n\nNow, we need to consider the restriction that if Team A wins a prize, then Team B also wins a prize. There are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: Team A and Team B both win prizes. In this case, there are 3 prizes remaining to be awarded to 4 teams (excluding Team A and Team B). This is a permutations problem, and the number of outcomes is 4P3 = 24.\n\nCase 2: Team A wins a prize, but Team B does not win a prize. In this case, there are 2 prizes remaining to be awarded to 4 teams (excluding Team A and Team B). This is a permutations problem, and the number of outcomes is 4P2 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes W is 696 - 24 - 12 = 660.\n\nAnswer: {660}.",

        "Response": "Let's call the distance the man was from the site of the blast \"x\". \n\nWe know that sound travels at a speed of 330 m/s, so in the 30 minutes between the first and second blasts, the sound would have traveled a distance of: \n\n330 m/s * 30 min * 60 sec/min = 594,000 meters \n\nHowever, the man was already driving away from the site during this time, so we need to subtract the distance he covered in those 30 minutes. \n\nWe can use the formula: \n\ndistance = speed * time \n\nSince the man was driving at a constant speed, we can simplify this to: \n\ndistance = speed * (time since first blast) \n\nThe time since the first blast when the second blast occurred was: \n\n30 min 20 sec = 30.3333 min \n\nSo the distance the man covered in that time was: \n\ndistance = speed * (time since first blast) \ndistance = 330 m/s * 30.3333 min * 60 sec/min \ndistance = 594,594 meters \n\nNow we can find the distance the man was from the site when he heard the second blast: \n\ndistance from site = x - (distance sound traveled) + (distance man covered) \ndistance from site = x - 594,000 + 594,594 \ndistance from site = x + 594 \n\nWe know that the second blast occurred exactly 30 minutes after the first, so the sound had to travel a total distance of 330 m/s * 30 min * 60 sec/min = 594,000 meters. Therefore, the man must have been 594 meters away from the site when he heard the second blast. \n\nSo: \n\ndistance from site = x + 594 \n\nWe don't know the value of x, but we can see that the only answer choice that is 594 meters more than a multiple of 3300 (the number of meters the sound traveled in 10 minutes) is 6600 meters. \n\n6600 + 594 = 7194 \n\nSo the answer is {7194}.",

We have:\n\nPerimeter of base 1 = 2\u03c0r1\nPerimeter of base 2 = 2\u03c0r2 = 4\u03c0r1\nLength of slant height 1 = l1\nLength of slant height 2 = l2\n\nTotal length of wire = 2\u03c0r1 + 4\u03c0r1 + l1 + l2\n= 6\u03c0r1 + l1 + l2\n\nSubstituting the expressions for l1 and l2, we get:\n\nTotal length of wire = 6\u03c0r1 + r1\u221a(10)/5 + r1\u221a(10 + 4\u221a10)/5\n= r1(6\u03c0 + \u221a10/5 + \u221a(10 + 4\u221a10)/5)\n\nSince r1/r2 = 1/2, we can write r1 = x and r2 = 2x for some value of x. Then the ratio of the length of wire to the radius of the smaller cone is:\n\n(r1 + r2 + l1 + l2)/r1 = (x + 2x + l1 + l2)/x\n= 3 + (l1 + l2)/x\n\nSubstituting the expressions for l1 and l2, we get:\n\n(l1 + l2)/x = \u221a10/2 + \u221a(10 + 4\u221a10)/10\n= (1/2)(\u221a10 + \u221a(10 + 4\u221a10)/5)\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the length of wire to the radius of the smaller cone is:\n\n(3 + (l1 + l2)/x)/1 = 3 + (1/2)(\u221a10 + \u221a(10 + 4\u221a10)/5)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(3 + (1/2)(\u221a10 + \u221a(10 + 4\u221a10)/5))/1 = {2:9}\n\nTherefore, the answer is E) 2:9.",

        "Response": "We can start by using the formula:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n\nLet's call Angelina's speed from home to the grocery \"x\" (in meters per second) and the time it took her \"t\" (in seconds). Then we have:\n\n150 = x * t\n\nSolving for \"t\", we get:\n\nt = 150/x\n\nNext, we can use the fact that Angelina walked double the speed from the grocery to the gym. Let's call her speed from the grocery to the gym \"2x\" (in meters per second). We also know that she spent 10 seconds less on this part of the trip, so the time it took her was:\n\nt - 10\n\nUsing the formula again, we have:\n\n200 = 2x * (t - 10)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n100 = x * (t - 10)\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for \"t\" earlier, we get:\n\n100 = x * (150/x - 10)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n100 = 150 - 10x\n\nSolving for \"x\", we get:\n\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, Angelina's speed from the grocery to the gym was:\n\n2x = 10\n\nAnswer: {10}",

To find the acute angle, we subtract this from 360: \n\n360 - 132 = 228 degrees. \n\nBut this is still not the answer, since the question asks for the acute angle between the hands. The acute angle is the smaller of the two possible angles between the hands, which is 360 - 228 = 132 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {132\u25e6}.",

",
        "Response": "Let's start by finding out how many parts were planned to be produced. In 3 days, the company made 25 parts per day, so the total number of parts made in those 3 days is:\n\n3 days x 25 parts/day = 75 parts\n\nSince this is the number of parts planned to be produced, we can subtract it from the total number of parts made to find out how many extra parts were produced:\n\n100 extra parts = total parts made - planned parts\n\n100 = total parts made - 75\n\nTotal parts made = 175\n\nNow we need to find out how many days it took to make these parts. For the first 3 days, the company made 25 parts per day, so they made a total of:\n\n3 days x 25 parts/day = 75 parts\n\nThis means that they made the remaining parts (175 - 75 = 100) in:\n\n100 parts / 30 parts/day = 3.33 days\n\nSo the total number of days it took to make all the parts is:\n\n3 days + 3.33 days = 6.33 days\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n6 days\n\nTherefore, the company made {175} parts in {6} days.

        "Response": "Let's assume that the pipe can fill the tank in 1 hour. But due to the leakage, it takes 7 times longer, which means it takes 7 hours to fill the tank.\n\nNow, let's consider the leakage alone. Let's assume that the leakage can empty the full tank in x hours.\n\nAccording to the question, the combined effect of the pipe and the leakage is that the tank is not getting filled at all. This means that the amount of water leaking out of the tank in 1 hour is equal to the amount of water coming in through the pipe in 1 hour.\n\nSo, the amount of water coming in through the pipe in 1 hour is 1/7th of the tank's capacity (since it takes 7 hours to fill the tank). And the amount of water leaking out of the tank in 1 hour is 1/xth of the tank's capacity.\n\nSince these two amounts are equal, we can set up the equation:\n\n1/7 = 1/x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the leakage alone can empty the full tank in 7 hours, which is equal to 420 minutes.\n\nSo, the answer is {420}.",

This week, he earned more than twice as much as he did last week. If he sold x bicycles last week and y bicycles this week, which of the following statements must be true? I. y<2x II. y>x III. y>3\nOptions:  A)I,II only B)I only C)II only D)II,III only E)III only Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide the explanation followed by the answer.. ",
        "Response": "Let's first calculate David's earnings for last week. Since he only earns a fixed salary of $40 per week, we can ignore the bicycle sales commission. Therefore, his total earnings last week were $40.\n\nNow let's calculate his earnings for this week. We'll use the following formula:\n\nTotal earnings = Fixed salary + Commission\n\nFor the commission, we'll break it down into three parts based on the number of bicycles sold:\n\nCommission = $6 per bicycle for the first 6 bicycles + $12 per bicycle for the next 6 bicycles + $18 per bicycle for every bicycle sold after first 12\n\nSo if David sold y bicycles this week, we can write his total earnings as:\n\nTotal earnings = $40 + ($6 x min(y,6)) + ($12 x max(0,min(y-6,6))) + ($18 x max(0,y-12))\n\nNote that we use the \"min\" and \"max\" functions to make sure we're only counting the commission for the relevant number of bicycles sold.\n\nNow we know that David earned more than twice as much this week as he did last week. In other words:\n\nTotal earnings this week > 2 x Total earnings last week\n\nSubstituting in the formulas we derived above, we get:\n\n$40 + ($6 x min(y,6)) + ($12 x max(0,min(y-6,6))) + ($18 x max(0,y-12)) > 2 x $40\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n($6 x min(y,6)) + ($12 x max(0,min(y-6,6))) + ($18 x max(0,y-12)) > $40\n\nNow we can use this inequality to determine which statements must be true. We'll start by simplifying the left-hand side of the inequality:\n\n($6 x min(y,6)) + ($12 x max(0,min(y-6,6))) + ($18 x max(0,y-12))\n\n= $6 x min(y,6) + $12 x min(max(y-6,0),6) + $18 x max(y-12,0)\n\n= $6 x min(y,6) + $12 x min(y-6,6) + $18 x max(y-12,0)\n\n= $6y - $36 + $12 x min(y-6,6) + $18 x max(y-12,0)\n\nNow we can use this expression to test each statement:\n\nA) I, II only: This statement is true. If y is less than 2x, then the left-hand side of the inequality will be less than $40, which is not possible.\n\nB) I only: This statement is not true. It's possible for y to be less than x and still satisfy the inequality, as long as y is greater than or equal to 7.\n\nC) II only: This statement is not true. It's possible for y to be greater than x and still not satisfy the inequality, as long as y is less than or equal to 6.\n\nD) II, III only: This statement is true. If y is greater than x, then the left-hand side of the inequality will be greater than $40. Also, since the commission for each bicycle sold increases as y increases, the left-hand side of the inequality will continue to increase as y increases beyond x, making it even more likely to satisfy the inequality.\n\nE) III only: This statement is not true. It's possible for y to be greater than 3 and still not satisfy the inequality, as long as y is less than or equal to 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {A) I, II only}.",

        "Response": "Let the length, width, and height of the foil covered prism be $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively. Then we have the following equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nlwh &= 8^3 = 512 \\\\\n(l-2)(w-2)(h-2) &= 128 \\\\\nw &= 2l \\\\\nw &= 2h\n\\end{align*}\nFrom the second equation, we expand and simplify to get $lwh - 2(lh + lw + wh) + 4(l+w+h) - 8 = 128$. Substituting $w=2l$ and $w=2h$, we get $lwh - 8lh + 8l^2 - 8h^2 + 8lh - 8h^2 + 8l - 16h + 8 = 128$, which simplifies to $8l^2 - 16lh - 16h^2 + 8l - 16h + 136 = 0$. Dividing by 8 and rearranging, we get $l^2 + l - 2h^2 + l/2 - 2h + 17 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we get $l = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8h^2 - 8h}}{2}$. Since $l$ must be positive, we take the positive root and simplify to get $l = \\frac{\\sqrt{8h^2 - 8h + 1} - 1}{2}$. Substituting $w=2l$ and $w=2h$, we get $w = \\sqrt{2(8h^2 - 8h + 1)} - 2h$.\nSince $w$ is an integer, we want $2(8h^2 - 8h + 1)$ to be a perfect square. Checking perfect squares mod 8, we see that the only possibility is $2(8h^2 - 8h + 1) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$, which occurs when $h \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. Letting $h=5$, we get $w = \\sqrt{2(8(5^2) - 8(5) + 1)} - 2(5) = \\sqrt{386} - 10 \\approx \\boxed{9.8}$.",

The probability of picking a red ball on the second draw, given that a white ball was picked on the first draw, is 4/8, since there are now four red balls and eight total balls left. So the probability of picking a white ball followed by a red ball is (5/9) * (4/8) = 5/18. \n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a red ball on the first draw and a white ball on the second draw is (4/9) * (5/8) = 5/18. \n\nAdding these probabilities together, we get a total probability of 5/18 + 5/18 = 5/9. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {5/9}.",

        "Response": "We can start by finding the time it takes for them to meet. Let's call this time \"t\". \n\nWe know that Car P is traveling northbound at 46 mph and Car Q is traveling southbound at 54 mph. When they are approaching each other, their combined speed is 46 mph + 54 mph = 100 mph. \n\nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up an equation: \n\n190 miles = 100 mph x t \n\nSolving for t, we get t = 1.9 hours. \n\nNow we need to find the time when they are moving away from each other and 35 miles apart. Let's call this time \"x\". \n\nWe know that after they pass each other, they will continue to travel in their respective directions. So we need to find the distance each car travels before they are 35 miles apart. \n\nSince they are traveling in opposite directions, we can add their speeds to find their relative speed: \n\n46 mph + 54 mph = 100 mph \n\nSo they are moving away from each other at a rate of 100 mph. \n\nTo find the distance they travel before they are 35 miles apart, we can use the formula distance = rate x time again: \n\n35 miles = 100 mph x (x - 1.9 hours) \n\nSolving for x, we get x = 2.25 hours. \n\nBut we need to find the clock time, not the number of hours. \n\nIf they passed each other at 2:00 pm and they met after 1.9 hours, then they must have passed each other at 3:54 pm. \n\nIf they are moving away from each other and 35 miles apart after 2.25 hours, then it must be 3:54 pm + 2.25 hours = 6:09 pm. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {D) 4:15 pm}.",

        "Response": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the mean and standard deviation of the 12 listed amounts. \n\nMean: \n(7.51 + 8.22 + 7.86 + 8.36 + 8.09 + 7.83 + 8.30 + 8.01 + 7.73 + 8.25 + 7.96 + 8.53) / 12 = 8.11 \n\nStandard deviation: \nWe can use the formula for sample standard deviation: \ns = sqrt((\u03a3(x - x\u0304)^2) / (n - 1)) \n\nwhere \u03a3(x - x\u0304)^2 is the sum of squared deviations from the mean, n is the sample size (12 in this case), and sqrt is the square root function. \n\nPlugging in the values: \ns = sqrt(((7.51 - 8.11)^2 + (8.22 - 8.11)^2 + ... + (8.53 - 8.11)^2) / (12 - 1)) \ns = 0.235 \n\nNow we can use the formula for z-score: \nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3 \n\nwhere x is the individual amount, \u03bc is the mean, \u03c3 is the standard deviation, and z is the number of standard deviations away from the mean. \n\nWe want to find the number of amounts that are within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean, which means their z-scores are between -1.5 and 1.5. \n\nFor each of the 12 amounts, we can calculate its z-score: \n\nz = (x - 8.11) / 0.235 \n\nThen we can count how many z-scores are between -1.5 and 1.5. \n\nUsing a calculator or a table of standard normal probabilities, we find that there are 9 z-scores between -1.5 and 1.5.

        "Response": "Let's first convert the units to be consistent. We can convert the hiker's speed to miles per minute by dividing by 60: 7/60 miles per minute. Similarly, the cyclist's speed is 28/60 miles per minute.\n\nWhen the cyclist passes the hiker, they are already ahead by a distance of (28/60 - 7/60) miles per minute, which simplifies to 21/60 miles per minute. We can call this distance \"d\".\n\nAfter waiting for 5 minutes, the cyclist has covered a distance of (28/60) * 5 = 7/12 miles. At this point, the hiker has covered a distance of (7/60) * 5 = 7/12 miles as well, since they are both moving at a constant rate.\n\nSo now the hiker is behind the cyclist by a distance of d - 7/12 miles. We want to know how long it will take for the hiker to catch up to the cyclist, which means they will have covered the same distance. We can set up an equation:\n\nd - 7/12 = (7/60) * t\n\nwhere \"t\" is the time in minutes that the hiker will take to catch up to the cyclist. Solving for \"t\", we get:\n\nt = (12/7) * (d - 7/12)\n\nNow we just need to plug in the value we found for \"d\":\n\nt = (12/7) * (21/60) = 3\n\nSo the cyclist must wait for 3 minutes until the hiker catches up.

Since k < m < r < s < t, we know that the sum of the two smallest integers (k and m) must be less than or equal to 10 (the average). Similarly, the sum of the two largest integers (s and t) must be greater than or equal to 20. \n\nSo, we can set up the following inequalities: \n\nk + m \u2264 10 - r (since r is the median, the sum of the two smallest integers must be less than or equal to 10 - r) \n\ns + t \u2265 20 - r (since r is the median, the sum of the two largest integers must be greater than or equal to 20 - r) \n\nWe want to maximize r, so we want to minimize the sum of k and m and maximize the sum of s and t.

Then we have x^3 + 1, which is a sum of cubes and can be factored as (x+1)(x^2-x+1). Since x = 2^32 is divisible by R, x+1 is also divisible by R. However, x^2-x+1 is not divisible by R.

        "Response": "We know that FOG is a three-digit number, so the maximum value it can have is 999. Therefore, the maximum value of FOG + FOG + FOG + FOG is 3996. This means that FOG + FOG + FOG + FOG must be less than or equal to 3996.\n\nTo find the possible values of FOG, we can start by looking at the units digit. Since FOG + FOG + FOG + FOG ends in 4, the units digit of FOG must be either 2 or 7 (since 2+2+2+2=8 and 7+7+7+7=28). \n\nIf the units digit of FOG is 2, then the only possible values for FOG are 122, 222, 322, 422, 522, 622, 722, 822, and 922. If the units digit of FOG is 7, then the only possible values for FOG are 127, 227, 327, 427, 527, 627, 727, 827, and 927.\n\nWe can now try each of these values for FOG and see if they satisfy the equation. For example, if we try FOG = 222, then we have:\n\n222 + 222 + 222 + 222 = 888\n\nThis is not equal to 1464, so we can eliminate FOG = 222 as a possibility. Continuing in this way, we find that the only possible values for FOG are 127 and 322. \n\nIf FOG = 127, then we have:\n\n127 + 127 + 127 + 127 = 508\n\nThis is not equal to 1464, so we can eliminate FOG = 127 as a possibility. \n\nIf FOG = 322, then we have:\n\n322 + 322 + 322 + 322 = 1288\n\nThis is also not equal to 1464, so we can eliminate FOG = 322 as a possibility. \n\nTherefore, there are no solutions to the equation, and we cannot find the value of F + O + G. \n\nAnswer: {None}",

        "Response": "We need to find the number of odd 4-digit positive integers that are multiples of 5 and do not contain the digit 3. \n\nFirst, we consider the units digit. Since the number is a multiple of 5, the units digit must be either 5 or 0. However, we cannot use the digit 3, so the units digit must be 5. \n\nNext, we consider the thousands digit. Since the number is odd, the thousands digit must be odd. We cannot use the digit 3, so there are 4 choices for the thousands digit: 1, 5, 7, or 9. \n\nFor the hundreds digit and the tens digit, we can use any of the remaining 8 digits (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Therefore, there are 8 choices for each of these digits. \n\nUsing the multiplication principle, the total number of odd 4-digit positive integers that are multiples of 5 and do not contain the digit 3 is:\n\n4 choices for the thousands digit \u00d7 8 choices for the hundreds digit \u00d7 8 choices for the tens digit \u00d7 1 choice for the units digit = 256 \u00d7 5 = 1280\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the numbers that have 0 as the hundreds digit (since they would not be 4-digit numbers).

We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide the explanation followed by the answer.. ",
        "Response": "We can start by listing out all the possible combinations of the five prime numbers in the envelopes. There are $3^5 = 243$ ways to distribute the cards among the envelopes. \n\nNext, we need to find the product of the numbers in each envelope. If all the cards are in one envelope, the product is simply the product of all five primes. If the cards are split between two envelopes, we can find the product of the numbers in each envelope by multiplying the primes in one envelope and the primes in the other envelope. If the cards are split between three envelopes, we can find the product of the numbers in each envelope by multiplying the primes in each envelope. \n\nNow we need to find the number of distinct sets we can create. To do this, we need to find the number of distinct triples of envelope numbers. \n\nFirst, we can consider the case where all three envelope numbers are distinct. In this case, we can simply count the number of ways to choose three distinct envelope numbers from the 243 possible combinations. This is given by $\\binom{243}{3}$. \n\nNext, we can consider the case where two of the envelope numbers are the same. There are three ways to choose which envelope number is repeated, and $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose which two primes are in that envelope. The remaining three primes can be split between the other two envelopes in $2^3$ ways (since each prime can go in one of two envelopes). This gives a total of $3 \\cdot \\binom{5}{2} \\cdot 2^3 = 240$ distinct sets. \n\nFinally, we can consider the case where all three envelope numbers are the same. In this case, there are $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways to choose which three primes are in the envelope, and the other two primes can be split between the other two envelopes in $2^2$ ways. This gives a total of $\\binom{5}{3} \\cdot 2^2 = 40$ distinct sets. \n\nAdding up the number of distinct sets in each case, we get a total of $\\binom{243}{3} + 240 + 40 = 31{,}860$ distinct sets. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\{31860\\}}$.",

We have:\n\n1683 = 20 \u00d7 84 + 3\n\nSo the remainder when 1683 is divided by 20 is 3. This means that the remainder when s is divided by t could be 3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {3}.",

We know that 18 percent of the female officers were on duty, but we don't know what percentage of the male officers were on duty.

One way to do this is to use the fact that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

This line passes through P, so its equation is:\n\n$y-6 = \\frac{2}{3}(x-4)$\n\n$y = \\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{4}{3}$\n\nSetting this equal to the equation of AB, which is:\n\n$y = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 12$\n\nwe can solve for x and y to find the coordinates of Q:\n\n$\\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{4}{3} = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 12$\n\n$\\frac{17}{24}x = \\frac{40}{3}$\n\n$x = \\frac{320}{51}$\n\n$y = \\frac{136}{17}$\n\nNote that x and y are not necessarily integers, but we know that Q is the closest point to P on AB, so the coordinates of Q must be integers.

We can start by simplifying 5n:\n5n = 5(15a + 8)\n5n = 75a + 40\n\nTo find the remainder when 5n is divided by 6, we need to divide 75a + 40 by 6 and find the remainder. We can simplify this expression further by dividing both terms by 3:\n5n = 25(3a) + 4(10)\n\nNow, we can see that the second term (4(10)) will leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6. So, we just need to find the remainder when 25(3a) is divided by 6. Since 25 is not divisible by 6, we need to look at the remainder when 3a is divided by 6. This will depend on the value of a:\n\n- If a is even, then 3a is even and will leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 6.\n- If a is odd, then 3a is odd and will leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 6.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 5n is divided by 6 will be either 4 or 1, depending on the parity of a.

Then the cost of a small LemonHead doll is $x-1.\nIf Danny buys only large LemonHead dolls, he can buy 360/x dolls.\nIf Danny buys only small LemonHead dolls, he can buy 5 more dolls, so he can buy 360/(x-1) + 5 dolls.\nSince these two expressions represent the same number of dolls, we can set them equal to each other and solve for x:\n360/x = 360/(x-1) + 5\nMultiplying both sides by x(x-1), we get:\n360(x-1) = 360x + 5x(x-1)\nExpanding and simplifying:\n360x - 360 = 360x + 5x^2 - 5x\nRearranging and simplifying:\n5x^2 - 5x - 360 = 0\nDividing both sides by 5:\nx^2 - x - 72 = 0\nFactoring:\n(x-9)(x+8) = 0\nSince x represents a cost, we can ignore the negative solution and conclude that a large LemonHead doll costs $9.

Therefore, we need to divide by 2! twice to account for these duplicate arrangements. \n\nSo the total number of arrangements with E as the first letter and R as the last letter is:\n\n11!/(2!2!) = 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 / (2 x 1 x 2 x 1) / (2 x 1 x 2 x 1) = 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 / (2 x 2) = 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 3\n\nTherefore, the probability Q of randomly selecting an arrangement of the letters of the word MEDITERRANEAN in which the first letter is E and the last letter is R is:\n\nQ = (number of arrangements with E as first letter and R as last letter) / (total number of arrangements)\n\nQ = (11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 3) / 13!\n\nQ = 1/20\n\nTherefore, the answer is {B)1/20}.",

        "Response": "Let's start by setting up an equation based on the given information. In 6 years, Charles will be C + 6 years old, and 2 years ago, Sarah was S - 2 years old. We know that Charles will be at least as old as Sarah was 2 years ago, so we can write:\n\nC + 6 \u2265 S - 2\n\nNow we can simplify this inequality by adding 2 to both sides:\n\nC + 8 \u2265 S\n\nThis tells us that in 6 years, Charles will be at least as old as Sarah is now. \n\nTo determine which of the answer choices must be true, we can use the given information to eliminate some options. \n\nOption A) C + 6 < S - 2: This contradicts the given information, since we know that C + 6 is greater than or equal to S - 2. \n\nOption B) C + 6 \u2264 S + 2: This could be true, but we can't say for certain. \n\nOption C) C + 6 = S - 2: This contradicts the given information, since we know that Charles will be at least as old as Sarah was 2 years ago, not exactly the same age. \n\nOption D) C + 6 > S - 2: This is always true, since we already established that C + 6 is greater than or equal to S - 2. \n\nOption E) C + 6 \u2265 S - 2: This is also always true, since we already established that C + 6 is greater than or equal to S - 2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {D or E}.",
