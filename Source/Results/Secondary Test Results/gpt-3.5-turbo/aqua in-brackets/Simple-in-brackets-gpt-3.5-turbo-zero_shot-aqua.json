        "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks before they meet \"x\". This means that Friend P walks the remaining distance of 43-x. \n\nWe can use the formula: \n\ndistance = rate x time \n\nLet's call Friend Q's rate \"r\". Then Friend P's rate is 15% faster, or 1.15r. \n\nWe know that both friends start at the same time, so they will meet in the middle after walking for the same amount of time. Let's call this time \"t\". \n\nFor Friend Q: \n\nx = rt \n\nFor Friend P: \n\n43-x = (1.15r)t \n\nWe can solve for \"t\" by adding the two equations together: \n\n43 = rt + (1.15r)t \n\n43 = 2.15rt \n\nt = 20 \n\nNow we can use either equation to find how far Friend P walked: \n\n43-x = (1.15r)t \n\n43-x = (1.15r)(20) \n\n43-x = 23r \n\nx = 43 - 23r \n\nBut we know that x = rt, so: \n\nrt = 43 - 23r \n\n24r = 43 \n\nr = 1.79 \n\nSo Friend P's rate is 1.15(1.79) = 2.06 \n\nAnd Friend P walks: \n\n43-x = (1.15r)t \n\n43-x = (1.15)(2.06)(20) \n\n43-x = 47.38 \n\nx = 43 - 47.38 = -4.38 \n\nWait a minute... a negative distance? That doesn't make sense! \n\nWhat went wrong? \n\nWe made an assumption that Friend Q walks further than Friend P before they meet. But in reality, we don't know which friend walks further. \n\nLet's try again, but this time we'll call the distance Friend P walks before they meet \"x\". This means that Friend Q walks the remaining distance of 43-x. \n\nFor Friend P: \n\nx = (1.15r)t \n\nFor Friend Q: \n\n43-x = rt \n\nWe can still use the equation 43 = rt + (1.15r)t to solve for \"t\": \n\n43 = 2.15rt \n\nt = 20 \n\nNow we can use either equation to find how far Friend P walked: \n\nx = (1.15r)t \n\nx = (1.15)(1.79)(20) \n\nx = 41.14 \n\nSo Friend P walks 41.14 km when they meet. \n\nAnswer: {22.5 km} (rounded to one decimal place)",

        "Response": "First, we can count the total number of ways to seat the 3 people in 5 chairs, which is 5! = 120. \n\nNext, we can count the number of ways the couple sits together. We can treat the couple as a single entity, so there are 4 entities to seat in 5 chairs. The couple can sit in any of the 4 adjacent pairs of chairs, and there are 2 ways to arrange the couple within each pair. The remaining person can sit in any of the 3 remaining chairs. Therefore, the number of ways the couple sits together is 4 x 2 x 3 = 24. \n\nFinally, we can subtract the number of ways the couple sits together from the total number of ways to seat the 3 people to get the number of ways the couple does not sit together: 120 - 24 = 96. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the couple does not sit together is 96/120 = 4/5. \n\nAnswer: {B)4/5}.",

There are 5 odd digits to choose from (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9), so there are $5^4$ ways to choose $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. There are 5 choices for $e$ (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8). Therefore, there are $5^4 \\cdot 5 = 625 \\cdot 5 = 3125$ integers in this case.\n\nAdding the number of integers from each case, we get a total of $3125+3125 = 6250$ integers.

After this process, the amount of water in the vessel will be 3 - (3/8)x + x liters (we are subtracting the amount of water we drew off and adding the amount we replaced it with), and the amount of syrup will be 5 - (5/8)x liters (similarly, we are subtracting the amount of syrup we drew off and not adding anything to it). \n\nWe want the mixture to be half water and half syrup, which means that the amount of water and syrup should be equal.

If Store A's average (arithmetic mean) monthly revenue for the three months was $2,000 greater than Store B's average monthly revenue, then Store B's revenue in the third month was how much greater than Store A's revenue?\nOptions:  A) $14,000 B) $40,000 C) $42,000 D) $46,000 E) $50,000 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n ",
        "Response": "Let's call Store A's revenues for the first, second, and third months $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$, respectively. Similarly, let's call Store B's revenues for the first, second, and third months $B_1$, $B_2$, and $B_3$, respectively. \n\nWe know that $A_1 = B_1 + 40,000$ and $A_2 = B_2 + 6,000$. We also know that the average monthly revenue for Store A is $2,000$ greater than the average monthly revenue for Store B. This means that:\n\n$$\\frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3}{3} - \\frac{B_1 + B_2 + B_3}{3} = 2,000$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{(A_1 + A_2 + A_3) - (B_1 + B_2 + B_3)}{3} = 2,000$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $3$, we get:\n\n$$(A_1 + A_2 + A_3) - (B_1 + B_2 + B_3) = 6,000$$\n\nNow we can substitute in the values we know:\n\n$$(B_1 + 40,000 + B_2 + 6,000 + A_3) - (B_1 + B_2 + B_3) = 6,000$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$A_3 = B_3 + 40,000$$\n\nSo Store B's revenue in the third month was $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }$14,000}$ greater than Store A's revenue.",

Similarly, if 4 women can reap a field in 10 days, then one woman can reap the field in 4 times as long, or 40 days. Therefore, one man can do $\\frac{1}{30}$ of the work in one day, and one woman can do $\\frac{1}{40}$ of the work in one day.\n\nNow, let's find the amount of work that can be done by 5 men and 6 women in one day. In one day, the 5 men can do 5 times as much work as one man, or $\\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of the work. Similarly, the 6 women can do 6 times as much work as one woman, or $\\frac{6}{40} = \\frac{3}{20}$ of the work. Therefore, 5 men and 6 women can do $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{3}{20} = \\frac{2}{15}$ of the work in one day.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula $W = RT$ (work = rate x time) to find how long it will take 5 men and 6 women to reap the field. We know that the amount of work is 1 (the whole field), and the rate is $\\frac{2}{15}$ (the amount of work that can be done in one day). Let's call the time it takes to reap the field $t$. Then we have:\n\n$$1 = \\frac{2}{15}t$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\frac{15}{2}$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{15}{2} = t$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$t = \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{30}{4} = \\frac{45}{6}$$\n\nTherefore, it will take 5 men and 6 women $\\frac{45}{6}$ days to reap the field, which simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}$ days.",

What is the greatest possible number of pets that could have been adopted from the animal shelter between Monday and Friday?\nOptions:  A)10 B)11 C)12 D)13 E)14 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n ",
        "Response": "There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use fractions and common denominators to find the total number of pets that were not adopted by Friday, and then subtract that from the initial total of 45 to get the maximum number of pets that could have been adopted.\n\nLet's start by finding the fraction of cats that were not adopted by Friday. Since 1/5 of the cats were adopted, that means 4/5 of the cats were still in the shelter. Therefore, the fraction of cats that were not adopted is 4/5.\n\nSimilarly, the fraction of dogs that were not adopted by Friday is 3/4, since 1/4 of the dogs were adopted and 3/4 were still in the shelter.\n\nTo find the total fraction of pets that were not adopted, we need to add the fractions for cats and dogs together. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20, so we can rewrite 4/5 as 16/20 and 3/4 as 15/20. Then, adding these fractions gives:\n\n16/20 + 15/20 = 31/20\n\nThis means that 31/20 of the pets were still in the shelter by Friday. To find the actual number of pets, we can multiply this fraction by the initial total of 45:\n\n31/20 x 45 = 69.75\n\nHowever, we can't have a fraction of a pet, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of pets that could have been adopted is:\n\n45 - 69.75 \u2248 24\n\nTo check that this answer is reasonable, we can see that if all 10 cats and 11 dogs were adopted, that would account for a total of 21 pets, which is less than 24.

        "Response": "We can start by looking at the last digit of the 8 digit number. If it is multiplied by 9, the product must end in 9.

        "Response": "Let's use the formula for the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand:\n\n\u03b8 = |30h - 11m/2|\n\nwhere h is the hour and m is the minute.\n\nAt 8 o'clock, the hour hand is at 240 degrees (since it's 2/3 of the way from 8 to 9), and the minute hand is at 0 degrees. So the angle between them is:\n\n\u03b8 = |30(8) - 11(0)/2| = 120 degrees\n\nNow we want to find when the hands will be in the same straight line but not together. This happens twice in a full rotation of the clock (since the minute hand makes a full rotation for every rotation of the hour hand). The first time is when the minute hand is ahead of the hour hand, and the second time is when the minute hand is behind the hour hand.\n\nTo find the time when the minute hand is ahead of the hour hand, we need to find the angle between them that is closest to 120 degrees but greater than 120 degrees. We can do this by setting \u03b8 = 120 + x, where x is some positive angle. Then we solve for h and m:\n\n120 + x = |30h - 11m/2|\n240 + 2x = 60h - 11m\n240 + 2x = 11(60h - m)\n240 + 2x = 11(5h + m)\n\nNow we can use trial and error to find values of h and m that satisfy this equation. We know that h is between 8 and 9, so let's try h = 8. We get:\n\n240 + 2x = 11(40 + m)\n240 + 2x = 440 + 11m\n2x - 11m = 200\n\nWe can see that m must be odd (since 2x - 11m is even), so let's try m = 1. We get:\n\n2x - 11 = 200\n2x = 211\nx = 105.5\n\nSo the minute hand will be ahead of the hour hand by 105.5 degrees at approximately 8:10:45 (since the minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute).\n\nTo find the time when the minute hand is behind the hour hand, we need to find the angle between them that is closest to 120 degrees but less than 120 degrees. We can do this by setting \u03b8 = 120 - x, where x is some positive angle. Then we solve for h and m:\n\n120 - x = |30h - 11m/2|\n240 - 2x = 60h - 11m\n240 - 2x = 11(60h - m)\n240 - 2x = 11(5h + m)\n\nAgain, we can use trial and error to find values of h and m that satisfy this equation. Let's try h = 8 again. We get:\n\n240 - 2x = 11(40 + m)\n240 - 2x = 440 + 11m\n-2x - 11m = 200\n\nWe can see that m must be even (since -2x - 11m is even), so let's try m = 2. We get:\n\n-2x - 22 = 200\n-2x = 222\nx = -111\n\nThis gives us a negative value for x, which doesn't make sense.

In 30 minutes, or 1800 seconds, the bells will toll together 1800/60 = 30 times. However, we need to subtract the times when they toll together at the beginning (when all the bells start tolling) and at the end (when all the bells finish tolling). At the beginning, they all toll together at time 0, and at the end, they all toll together at time 1770 (30 minutes minus the longest time interval of 12 seconds).

So we can write:\n\nB's rent = 1.5A's rate x 3 x x\n\nWe want the total rent for the pasture to be the same for both A and B, so we can set the two rents equal to each other and solve for x:\n\nA's rate x 7 x 80 = 1.5A's rate x 3 x x\n560A's rate = 4.5A's rate x\nx = 560/4.5\nx = 124.44\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a cow, we round up to the nearest whole number and get:\n\nx = 125\n\nTherefore, B can put in 125 cows for the remaining 3 months. To check, we can calculate B's rent:\n\nB's rent = 1.5A's rate x 3 x x\nB's rent = 1.5A's rate x 3 x 125\nB's rent = 562.5A's rate\n\nWe know that A's rent is A's rate x 7 x 80, so we can calculate A's rate:\n\nA's rent = A's rate x 7 x 80\nA's rate = A's rent / (7 x 80)\nA's rate = A's rent / 560\n\nWe also know that B pays 1.5 times A's rate, so we can calculate B's rate:\n\nB's rate = 1.5A's rate\nB's rate = 1.5(A's rent / 560)\nB's rate = 1.5(A's rent) / 560\n\nNow we can substitute these values into B's rent formula:\n\nB's rent = 562.5A's rate\nB's rent = 562.5(1.5A's rent / 560)\nB's rent = 1.40625A's rent\n\nWe want A and B to pay the same rent, so we can set their rents equal to each other and solve for A's rent:\n\nA's rate x 7 x 80 = B's rate x 3 x 125\nA's rate x 560 = B's rate x 375\nA's rate x 560 = 1.40625A's rent x 375\nA's rent = 560 / 1.40625\nA's rent = 398.22\n\nTherefore, A's rate is 398.22 / 560 = 0.7108, and B's rate is 1.5 times that, or 1.0662. We can check that A's rent for 7 months with 80 cows is:\n\nA's rent = A's rate x 7 x 80\nA's rent = 0.7108 x 7 x 80\nA's rent = 398.22\n\nAnd B's rent for 3 months with 125 cows is:\n\nB's rent = B's rate x 3 x 125\nB's rent = 1.0662 x 3 x 125\nB's rent = 399.23\n\nThese rents are close enough to each other given rounding, so our answer is:\n\n{125}",

Let's assume that he wants to sell x oranges for 1 rupee. Therefore, his cost price per orange is 1/x rupees.

        "Response": "We can begin by converting the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s:\n78 km/hr = (78 x 1000 m) / (60 x 60 s) = 21.67 m/s\n\nWe also know that the train takes 1 minute to cross the tunnel, which is the same as 60 seconds.\n\nLet's assume that the length of the tunnel is x meters. During the time it takes for the train to cross the tunnel, it also travels a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the tunnel. So we can set up the following equation:\n\ndistance = speed x time\n500 + x = 21.67 x 60\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n500 + x = 1300.2\nx = 800.2\n\nTherefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 800 meters.

        "Response": "Let's first find out how much of Liquid P and Liquid Q are in the initial mixture of 30 liters. \n\nThe ratio of Liquid P to Liquid Q is 3:2, which means that for every 3 parts of Liquid P, there are 2 parts of Liquid Q. \n\nWe can represent this as: \n\nLiquid P = (3/5) * 30 = 18 liters \nLiquid Q = (2/5) * 30 = 12 liters \n\nNow we want to add some amount of Liquid Q to make the ratio 3:4. Let's call this amount \"x\". \n\nWe know that the ratio of Liquid P to Liquid Q should be 3:4 after we add x liters of Liquid Q. This means that: \n\nLiquid P = 3/7 * (30 + x) \nLiquid Q = 4/7 * (30 + x) \n\nWe want to find the value of x that will make the amount of Liquid Q equal to the amount of Liquid P multiplied by 4/3 (since the ratio is 3:4). \n\nSo we can set up the equation: \n\n4/3 * Liquid P = Liquid Q \n\nSubstituting in the values we found earlier: \n\n4/3 * 18 = 4/7 * (30 + x) \n\nSimplifying: \n\n24 = (120 + 4x)/7 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 7: \n\n168 = 120 + 4x \n\nSubtracting 120 from both sides: \n\n48 = 4x \n\nDividing both sides by 4: \n\nx = 12 \n\nTherefore, we need to add 12 liters of Liquid Q to make the ratio 3:4. \n\nAnswer: {C)12}",

        "Response": "The probability of drawing a red apple on any one draw is $\\frac{8}{9}$. The probability of drawing a red apple on all $n$ draws is $\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)^n$. We want this probability to be less than $0.5$, so we have the inequality $\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)^n<0.5$. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get $n\\log\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)<\\log(0.5)$. Dividing both sides by $\\log\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)$ (which is negative), we get $n>\\frac{\\log(0.5)}{\\log\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)}\\approx 5.02$.

Then, $\\frac{1}{5}x$ of these are rented, so there are $\\frac{1}{5}x\\cdot\\frac{4}{7}=\\frac{4}{35}x$ rented one-bedroom units. \n\nSince the ratio of two-bedroom units to one-bedroom units is 6:1 among the rented units, we can write $6y=x$, where $y$ is the number of rented two-bedroom units.

There are $3!=6$ ways to seat the males without any restrictions. However, we must subtract the number of arrangements where two males sit next to each other. There are three ways to choose which two males sit next to each other, and then we can treat them as a single person, so there are $2!=2$ ways to arrange them. The remaining person can be seated in two ways (either to the left or right of the pair). Thus, there are $3\\times 2\\times 2=12$ arrangements where two males sit next to each other.

There are $3\\cdot23^2=1587$ possible license plates for all vehicles. The probability that a government vehicle has a license plate starting with 79 is $\\frac{1}{10}\\cdot\\frac{1}{10}\\cdot3=\\frac{3}{1000}$. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected vehicle has a license plate starting with 79 is $\\frac{3}{1000}\\cdot1587=\\frac{4761}{1000}$. \n\nTo find the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours, we need to find the probability that they will inspect fewer than 20 vehicles.

From the problem, we know that he earns $6 per bicycle for the first 6 bicycles he sells, so he earned $6x for those bicycles. He earns $12 per bicycle for the next 6 bicycles he sells, so he earned $12(6) = $72 for those bicycles. Finally, he earns $18 per bicycle for every bicycle sold after the first 12, so he earned $18(x-12) for those bicycles.

        "Response": "Let the length, width, and height of the foil covered prism be $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively. Then we have $lw+lh+wh=2(2l+2h+wh)$, since the surface area of the foil covered prism is equal to the surface area of the $128$ cubes plus the surface area of the foil covered prism itself. Simplifying this equation gives $lw+lh+wh=4l+4h+2wh$, or $(w+2)(l+h)=4(l+h)$. Since $l$, $w$, and $h$ are all integers, we know that $l+h$ must be a factor of $4$. Since $w=2l$ and $w=2h$, we have $w=2\\sqrt{lh}$. We also know that the volume of the foil covered prism is equal to the volume of the $128$ cubes, or $128$. Thus, $lwh=128$. We can substitute $w=2\\sqrt{lh}$ into this equation to get $2l^2h=128$, or $lh=64$. Since $l+h$ must be a factor of $4$ and $lh=64$, the only possible values for $(l,h)$ are $(1,64)$, $(2,32)$, $(4,16)$, and $(8,8)$. Checking each of these cases, we find that $(l,h)=(8,8)$ is the only one that works. Thus, $w=2\\sqrt{lh}=2\\sqrt{64}=16$, and the surface area of the foil covered prism is $2lw+2lh+2wh=2(8\\cdot 16+8\\cdot 8+16\\cdot 8)=\\boxed{1024}$ square inches.",

        "Response": "Let the common remainder be $r$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\n1305-r &= n_1k \\\\\n4665-r &= n_2k \\\\\n6905-r &= n_3k\n\\end{align*} where $n_1=5\\cdot 7\\cdot 19$, $n_2=3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 47$, $n_3=5\\cdot 7\\cdot 197$, and $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$. We want to find $k$.\n\nNote that $k$ must divide $4665-1305=3360$, $6905-4665=2240$, and $6905-1305=5600$. Also, $k$ must divide $\\gcd(n_1,n_2,n_3)=5\\cdot 7=35$. Thus, $k$ must be a divisor of $\\gcd(3360,2240,5600,35)=35$.\n\nTherefore, $k=1$ or $k=5$. If $k=1$, then $r$ must be a common divisor of $1305$, $4665$, and $6905$, which is impossible since $\\gcd(1305,4665,6905)=5$. Thus, $k=5$.\n\nNow, we have $1305-r=5n_1$, $4665-r=5n_2$, and $6905-r=5n_3$. Subtracting the first two equations gives $3360=5(n_1-n_2)$, so $n_1-n_2$ is a multiple of $672$. Similarly, subtracting the first and third equations gives $5600=5(n_1-n_3)$, so $n_1-n_3$ is a multiple of $1120$. Since $\\gcd(672,1120)=112$, it follows that $n_1-n_2$ is a multiple of $112$.\n\nWe have $n_1-n_2=672a$ and $n_1-n_3=1120b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$. Then $n_2=n_1-672a$ and $n_3=n_1-1120b$. Since $k=5$, we have $r=1305-5n_1=1305-5(n_1-n_2)=4665-5n_2=6905-5n_3$. Thus, \\begin{align*}\n1305-5n_1 &= 4665-5(n_1-672a) \\\\\n&= 6905-5(n_1-1120b)\n\\end{align*} Solving for $n_1$ in each equation gives $n_1=3360a+931$ and $n_1=2240b+1305$, respectively. Equating these expressions for $n_1$ gives $3360a+931=2240b+1305$, or $168a+47=112b+65$. Since $\\gcd(168,112)=56$, it follows that $a\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ and $b\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}$. Let $a=8c+1$ and $b=8d+3$ for some integers $c$ and $d$. Then $168a+47=1344c+215$ and $112b+65=896d+697$, so $1344c+215=896d+697$. Solving for $c$ gives $c=4d+1$.\n\nTherefore, $a=8(4d+1)+1=32d+9$ and $b=8d+3$. We have \\begin{align*}\nn_1 &= 3360a+931 = 107520d+30551 \\\\\nn_2 &= n_1-672a = 86016d+24479 \\\\\nn_3 &= n_1-1120b = 79840d+23111 \\\\\nr &= 1305-5n_1 = -5375-5375d\n\\end{align*} Thus, $N=\\gcd(n_1,n_2,n_3)=\\gcd(107520d+30551,86016d+24479,79840d+23111)$. Since $N$ divides $5375$, it follows that $N$ must be a divisor of $\\gcd(107520,86016,79840)=2688$. Also, $N$ must divide $\\gcd(30551,24479,23111)=1$. Therefore, $N=1$ or $N=16$.\n\nIf $N=1$, then the sum of the digits in $N$ is $\\boxed{\\{1\\}}$. If $N=16$, then the sum of the digits in $N$ is $\\boxed{\\{7\\}}$. However, we must check that $16$ actually works. We have $1305=81\\cdot 16+9$, $4665=291\\cdot 16+9$, and $6905=431\\cdot 16+9$, so $r=9$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\{1\\}}$.",

So, we can say that:\n3 engines of the former type consume = 4 engines of the latter type consume\n1 engine of the former type consumes = (4/3) engines of the latter type consume\n\nSubstituting this in the above equation, we get:\n8 engines of the former type working for 13 hours a day will consume:\n= (8/3) * 104x * (4/3) metric tonnes of coal\n= 111.11x metric tonnes of coal\n\nTherefore, we can equate the two expressions for coal consumption and solve for x:\n111.11x = 104x\nx = 0.936 metric tonnes of coal per hour\n\nSo, for 8 engines of the latter type working for 13 hours a day, the total coal consumption will be:\n8 engines * 13 hours * 0.936 metric tonnes of coal per hour = 96.384 metric tonnes of coal\n\nTherefore, the answer is {24}.",

(we don't know how many coins there are in total)\n\nTo solve for x and y, we need to eliminate one of the variables. We can do this by multiplying the second equation by -0.5 and adding it to the first equation:\n\n-0.5x - 0.5y = -0.5?   (multiply second equation by -0.5)\n0.5x + 0.7y = 4.6   (first equation)\n\n0.2y = 4.1 - 0.5?

We can try different values until we find one that works:\n\nIf ? = 1, then y = (4.1 - 0.5) / 0.2 = 20, which is a whole number. Therefore, x = ? - y = 1 - 20 = -19, which doesn't make sense (we can't have negative coins).\n\nIf ? = 2, then y = (4.1 - 1) / 0.2 = 15, which is a whole number.

Therefore, x = ? - y = 3 - 13 = -10, which still doesn't make sense.\n\nIf ? = 4, then y = (4.1 - 2) / 0.2 = 11, which is a whole number. Therefore, x = ? - y = 4 - 11 = -7, which doesn't make sense.\n\nIf ? = 5, then y = (4.1 - 2.5) / 0.2 = 9, which is a whole number.

        "Query": "In a certain mathematical activity, we have five cards with five different prime numbers on them. We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n ",
        "Response": "We can start by listing out all the possible combinations of the five prime numbers in the envelopes. There are $3^5 = 243$ ways to distribute the cards among the envelopes. However, we need to subtract the cases where at least one envelope is empty. There are $3$ ways to choose which envelope is empty, and $2^5 = 32$ ways to distribute the remaining cards among the non-empty envelopes. Therefore, there are $3 \\cdot 32 = 96$ invalid cases. \n\nNow, we need to count the number of distinct sets that can be produced. We can do this by listing out all the possible sets and checking which ones are distinct. \n\nFirst, consider the case where all three envelopes have exactly one card. There are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose which three primes go in the envelopes. Each of these sets is distinct, since the product of the cards in each envelope is unique. \n\nNext, consider the case where one envelope has two cards and the other two envelopes have one card each. There are $\\binom{5}{2} \\cdot 3 = 30$ ways to choose which two primes go in the same envelope. For each of these choices, there are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose which envelope gets the pair, and $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose which two primes go in the other envelope. Therefore, there are $30 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 = 540$ distinct sets that can be produced in this case. \n\nFinally, consider the case where one envelope has three cards and the other two envelopes have one card each. There are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose which three primes go in the same envelope. For each of these choices, there are $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose which envelope gets the triple, and $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$ ways to choose which of the remaining primes goes in the same envelope as the triple. Therefore, there are $10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 60$ distinct sets that can be produced in this case. \n\nIn total, there are $10 + 540 + 60 = 610$ distinct sets that can be produced. However, we need to subtract the $96$ invalid cases that we counted earlier, so the final answer is $\\boxed{\\{514\\}}$.",

        "Response": "Let's assume that the man initially had 100 oranges. He sold them at the rate of 12 a rupee, so he earned 100/12 = 8.33 rupees.

Let's assume that he wants to sell x oranges for 1 rupee. Therefore, his cost price per orange is 1/x rupees. He wants to gain 44% on this cost price, so his selling price per orange should be:\n\n1.44*(1/x) = (1 + 44/100)*(1/x) = (1.44/x) rupees\n\nHe earned 8 rupees by selling 100 oranges, so he should earn the same amount by selling x oranges at the new selling price:\n\n8 = x*(1.44/x)\n8 = 1.44\nx = 5.56\n\nTherefore, he should sell 5.56 oranges for 1 rupee to gain 44%. However, since this is not one of the options, we need to find the closest option. The closest option is 9 oranges for 1 rupee, which gives a selling price of 0.1111 rupees per orange.

        "Response": "Let's first convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s:\n54 km/hr = (54*1000)/3600 m/s = 15 m/s\n\nLet's denote the length of the platform as x, and the length of the train as y.\nFrom the information given in the problem, we can set up two equations:\nx + y = distance covered by the train in 36 sec\nx = distance covered by the man in 20 sec\n\nWe need to solve for x, so let's eliminate y by subtracting the second equation from the first:\nx + y - x = distance covered by the train in 36 sec - distance covered by the man in 20 sec\ny = 15*36 - 20 = 500 m\n\nNow we can substitute this value of y into the first equation and solve for x:\nx + 500 = distance covered by the train in 36 sec\nx + 500 = 15*36*1000/3600\nx + 500 = 150\nx = 150 - 500 = -350\n\nThis doesn't make sense, as the length of the platform cannot be negative. We made a mistake somewhere in our calculations. Let's check our equations again:\nx + y = distance covered by the train in 36 sec\nx = distance covered by the man in 20 sec\n\nWe made an assumption that the man was standing at the end of the platform closest to the train, but this may not be the case. Let's denote the distance between the man and the end of the platform closest to him as z. Then we can set up two new equations:\nx + y = distance covered by the train in 36 sec\nx - z = distance covered by the man in 20 sec\n\nWe still need to solve for x, but we now have an extra variable z. However, we can eliminate z by using the fact that the train and the man are both stationary relative to each other when the man is standing on the platform. This means that the distance covered by the train and the distance covered by the man must be equal:\ndistance covered by the train in 20 sec = distance covered by the man in 20 sec\ny - z = x\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for x into the first equation and solve for y:\ny - z + y = distance covered by the train in 36 sec\n2y - z = 15*36*1000/3600\n2y - z = 150\n\nWe still need another equation to eliminate z. Let's use the fact that the train passes the platform in 36 sec:\ndistance covered by the train in 36 sec = length of the platform + length of the train\ny + x = 15*36*1000/3600\ny + y - z = 15*36*1000/3600\n2y - z = 150\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables (y and z):\n2y - z = 150\ny - z = x\n\nWe can solve for y by adding the two equations:\n3y = 150 + x\ny = (150 + x)/3\n\nWe can substitute this expression for y into either of the two equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation:\n2y - z = 150\n2(150 + x)/3 - z = 150\n300 + 2x/3 - z = 450\n2x/3 - z = 150\n\nWe still need another equation to eliminate z. Let's use the fact that the man covers the length of the platform in 20 sec:\nx - z = length of the platform\n\nWe can substitute this expression for length of the platform into the previous equation:\n2x/3 - (x - 20) = length of the platform\n2x/3 + 20 = length of the platform\n\nWe now have an equation for the length of the platform in terms of x. We can substitute this expression into the equation for y:\ny = (150 + x)/3\ny = (150 + 3(length of the platform - 20))/9\ny = (510 - 3length of the platform)/9\ny = 170 - (1/3)length of the platform\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for y into the equation for the distance covered by the train in 36 sec:\n2y - z = 150\n2(170 - (1/3)length of the platform) - z = 150\n340 - (2/3)length of the platform - z = 150\n(2/3)length of the platform + z = 190\n\nWe now have two equations for the length of the platform in terms of x and z:\n2x/3 + 20 = length of the platform\n(2/3)length of the platform + z = 190\n\nWe can eliminate z by subtracting the second equation from the first:\n2x/3 + 20 - (2/3)length of the platform - z = 0\n2x/3 - (2/3)length of the platform + 20 - z = 0\n2(x - (1/3)length of the platform) + 20 - z = 0\n2(x - (1/3)length of the platform) = z - 20\n\nWe can substitute this expression for z into the previous equation:\n(2/3)length of the platform + z = 190\n(2/3)length of the platform + 2(x - (1/3)length of the platform) = 210\n(2/3)length of the platform + 2x/3 - 2/3(length of the platform) + 20 = 210\n2x/3 - (1/3)length of the platform = 190\n\nWe now have an equation for x in terms of the length of the platform:\n2x/3 - (1/3)length of the platform = 190\n2x/3 = (1/3)length of the platform + 190\nx = (3/2)((1/3)length of the platform + 190)\nx = (1/2)length of the platform + 285\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for x into the equation for the length of the platform:\n2x/3 + 20 = length of the platform\n2((1/2)length of the platform + 285)/3 + 20 = length of the platform\n(1/3)length of the platform + 380 = length of the platform\n(2/3)length of the platform = 380\nlength of the platform = 570\n\nTherefore, the length of the platform is {570}.",

The sum of the digits in any five-digit number using these digits is 15 plus the sum of the three remaining digits. To make the sum of the digits divisible by 3, we need to choose three digits whose sum is divisible by 3. The only possibilities are {0,3,6}, {1,4,5}, and {2,4,5}. \n\nFor the first case, we can choose the three digits in 3! ways and arrange them in 5!/(2!)=60 ways, for a total of 3!\u00d760=360 ways. Similarly, there are 3!\u00d760=360 ways for each of the other two cases. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to form a five-digit number divisible by 3 is W=360+360+360=1080. \n\nHowever, we need to eliminate the cases where the first digit is 0, which would make it a four-digit number.
