        "Response": "Let's call the distance that Friend Q walks \"x\". Then, Friend P will walk 15% more than that, or 1.15x. \n\nWe know that they will meet in the middle of the trail, so they will each have walked half of the total distance, which is 43 km/2 = 21.5 km. \n\nNow we can set up an equation: \n\nx + 1.15x = 21.5 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n2.15x = 21.5 \n\nx = 10 \n\nSo Friend Q will have walked 10 km when they meet. \n\nTo find out how far Friend P will have walked, we can plug x = 10 into the equation we set up earlier: \n\n1.15x = 1.15(10) = 11.5 \n\nSo Friend P will have walked 11.5 km when they meet. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {B) 21.5}.",

        "Response": "{D) $2500} \n\nExplanation: \n\nFirst, we need to determine the interest rate per year. Since the bank charges a quarterly compound rate of 4%, we can find the annual rate using the formula:\n\n(1 + r/4)^4 = 1 + r\n\nwhere r is the annual interest rate. Solving for r, we get:\n\nr = 0.04 * 4 = 0.16 or 16%\n\nNext, we can calculate the interest Carl pays annually by multiplying the loan amount by the annual interest rate:\n\n$10,000 * 0.16 = $1600\n\nTherefore, Carl pays approximately $2500 in interest annually.",

Then, the total number of students in the school is Q*C.\n\nIf the ratio of students per class were to be increased by 1, the new number of students per class would be Q+1. The total number of classes would be C-10, since there would be 10 fewer classes. The total number of students in the school would still be 120, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n(Q+1)*(C-10) = 120\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\nQC - 10Q + C - 10 = 120\n\nRearranging and simplifying, we get:\n\nQC - 10Q + C = 130\n\nFactoring out Q, we get:\n\nQ(C-10) + C = 130\n\nSince we know that Q*C = total number of students, we can substitute Q*C for C in the equation:\n\nQ(Q*C - 10) + Q*C = 130\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nQ^2*C - 10Q + Q*C = 130\n\nDividing both sides by C, we get:\n\nQ^2 - 10Q + Q = 130/C\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nQ^2 - 9Q = 130/C\n\nAt this point, we don't know the value of C, so we can't solve for Q directly.

If Q=4, then Q^2 - 9Q = 4, which means that 130/C = 1, or C=130.

        "Response": "We need to find the number of trees that can be planted along a 148-foot long street with 20 feet between each tree. Let's call the number of trees \"x\". \n\nEach tree takes up one square foot of sidewalk space, so the total sidewalk space taken up by the trees is \"x\" square feet. \n\nThe space between each tree is 20 feet, so the total space between the trees is (x-1) * 20 feet. \n\nThe total sidewalk space available is the length of the street, which is 148 feet. \n\nSo we can set up the equation: \n\nx + (x-1)*20 = 148 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n2x - 20 = 148 \n\n2x = 168 \n\nx = 84 \n\nBut we need to remember that \"x\" represents the number of trees, not the total sidewalk space taken up by the trees. So our answer is: \n\n{C) 10} \n\nExplanation: We can plant 10 trees along the street with 20 feet between each tree, leaving 9 spaces between them. The total sidewalk space taken up by the trees is 10 square feet, and the total space between the trees is 9 * 20 = 180 feet. Adding these together gives us a total sidewalk space of 190 feet, which is less than the length of the street (148 feet). Therefore, we can plant 10 trees along the street.",

        "Response": "Answer: D) 11\n\nExplanation:\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\nbc + ac + ab = abc\n\nDividing both sides by abc, we get:\n\n1/c + 1/b + 1/a = 1/abc\n\nSince a, b, and c are positive integers, the right-hand side is a fraction less than 1. Therefore, the left-hand side must also be a fraction less than 1. This means that c must be greater than 3.\n\nWe can also see that:\n\n1/a < 1/c\n\n1/b < 1/c\n\nAdding these inequalities, we get:\n\n1/a + 1/b < 2/c\n\nSince 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1, we can substitute 1/c with 1/a + 1/b:\n\n1/a + 1/b + 1/a + 1/b = 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n2/a + 2/b = 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by ab, we get:\n\n2b + 2a = ab\n\nDividing both sides by 2ab, we get:\n\n1/b + 1/a = 1/2\n\nSince a < b, we know that 1/b > 1/a. Therefore, 1/b must be the larger fraction on the left-hand side. This means that b must be less than 4.\n\nWe can now try different values of b and see if there exist corresponding values of a and c that satisfy the equation. If b = 4, then:\n\n1/a = 1/4 - 1/2 = -1/4\n\nThis is not possible since a must be a positive integer. Therefore, b must be 3.\n\nIf b = 3, then:\n\n1/a = 1/3 - 1/2 = 1/6\n\nThis means that a = 6. Substituting into the original equation, we get:\n\n1/6 + 1/3 + 1/c = 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1/c = 1/2\n\nThis means that c = 2. However, this contradicts the fact that a < b < c.

        "Response": "{273358} \n\nTo multiply two numbers, we need to multiply each digit of one number with each digit of the other number and add the products. \n\nHere, we can start by multiplying 8 (the units digit of 5358) with 1 (the units digit of 51), which gives 8. We write down 8 and carry-over 0. \n\nNext, we multiply 5 (the tens digit of 5358) with 1, which gives 5. We add the carry-over from the previous step (0) and get 5.

        "Response": "The probability that a customer bought a bagel is 3/5 and the probability that a customer bought a coffee is 5/7. Let's assume there were 35 customers in total (a common denominator of 5 and 7). Then, 21 customers bought a bagel (3/5 of 35) and 25 customers bought a coffee (5/7 of 35). However, we know that some customers bought both, so we need to adjust for that.\n\nLet x be the number of customers who bought both a bagel and a coffee. Then, we can set up the following equations:\n\n21 = 3y + x (where y is the number of customers who only bought a bagel)\n25 = 5y + x (where y is the number of customers who only bought a coffee)\n\nSolving for x and y, we get x = 7 and y = 4.

        "Response": "{82} chocolates were sold.\n\nLet's assume that the new price of each chocolate was x. Since the new price was not less than half the original price, we can write:\n\nx \u2265 1\n\nWe know that the shopkeeper realized Rs 164.90 from the sale of chocolates. We can set up an equation based on this information:\n\n2(0) + x(sold chocolates) = 164.90\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx(sold chocolates) = 164.90\n\nSince we don't know the exact value of x, we can't solve for the number of chocolates sold directly. However, we do know that the original price was Rs 2 and there were no sales at that price. This means that the new price must have been less than Rs 2. Let's assume that the new price was Rs 1.50. In this case, the number of chocolates sold would be:\n\n1.50(sold chocolates) = 164.90\n\nsold chocolates = 109.93\n\nThis is not a whole number, so our assumption that the new price was Rs 1.50 must be incorrect. Let's try again with a new assumption. Let's assume that the new price was Rs 1.60. In this case, the number of chocolates sold would be:\n\n1.60(sold chocolates) = 164.90\n\nsold chocolates = 103.06\n\nAgain, this is not a whole number. Let's keep trying with different assumptions until we get a whole number. We can use a table to keep track of our assumptions and the resulting number of chocolates sold:\n\n| New Price (x) | Sold Chocolates |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| 1.50          | 109.93         |\n| 1.60          | 103.06         |\n| 1.70          | 97.00          |\n| 1.80          | 91.61          |\n| 1.90          | 86.79          |\n| 2.00          | 82.45          |\n\nWe can see that when the new price is Rs 1.70, the number of chocolates sold is a whole number (97).

        "Response": "Answer: {C)14}\nExplanation:\nTo find the number of zeroes in the expression, we need to find the number of factors of 10 in the expression. Since 10 can be written as 2*5, we need to find the number of factors of 2 and 5 in the expression.\n\nFactors of 2:\n15 = 3*5\n32 = 2^5\n25 = 5^2\n22 = 2*11\n40 = 2^3*5\n75 = 3*5^2\n98 = 2*7^2\n112 = 2^4*7\n125 = 5^3\n\nThe total number of factors of 2 in the expression is 5+5+3+1+3+1+2+4 = 24.\n\nFactors of 5:\n15 = 3*5\n32 = 2^5\n25 = 5^2\n22 = 2*11\n40 = 2^3*5\n75 = 3*5^2\n98 = 2*7^2\n112 = 2^4*7\n125 = 5^3\n\nThe total number of factors of 5 in the expression is 1+0+2+0+1+2+0+0+3 = 9.\n\nSince the number of factors of 2 is greater than the number of factors of 5, the number of factors of 5 will determine the number of zeroes in the expression. Therefore, the number of zeroes in the expression is 9.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the fact that 125 can be written as 5^3, which means there are three additional factors of 5 in the expression. Therefore, the total number of factors of 5 in the expression is 9+3 = 12.\n\nThus, the number of zeroes in the expression is 12, which gives us the answer {C)14}.",

Therefore, we have:\n1 = k(60)^2\nk = 1/3600\nSo, the consumption of diesel per hour at a speed of x kmph is given by:\ny = (1/3600)x^2\nLet the total time taken to cover a distance of 600 km be t hours. Then, the speed of the bus is given by:\nspeed = distance/time = 600/t kmph\nThe total consumption of diesel during this time is given by:\ntotal consumption = (1/3600)(600/t)^2 t = (1/6)t\nThe cost of one litre of diesel is $60 and other expenses per hour is $60. Therefore, the total cost of diesel and other expenses for t hours is given by:\ntotal cost = (1/6)t * 60 + 60t = 10t + 60t = 70t\nTo minimize the total cost, we need to minimize t. The minimum value of t occurs when the speed is maximum. The maximum speed that the bus can attain is when the consumption of diesel per hour is 6 litres (since the bus can carry a maximum of 6 litres of diesel at a time).

        "Response": "Answer: {D)180}\n\nExplanation: To find the greatest possible number of points of intersection, we need to consider the scenario where all the circles intersect with each other. For this, we can draw a diagram where each circle intersects with every other circle. \n\nIf we have 15 circles, the number of possible intersections between them can be calculated using the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of circles. \n\nSo, for 15 circles, the number of possible intersections is 15(15-1)/2 = 105. However, we need to remember that each intersection point is counted twice (once for each circle), so we need to divide this number by 2 to get the actual number of intersection points. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of points with which the circles intersect is 105/2 = 52.5. However, since we cannot have half a point, we need to round this down to the nearest whole number, which is 52. \n\nBut we also need to consider the points where three circles intersect. If we have three circles intersecting at a point, this will be counted three times (once for each circle), so we need to add the number of such points to our previous result. \n\nThe number of points where three circles intersect can be calculated using the formula n(n-1)(n-2)/6, where n is the number of circles. \n\nSo, for 15 circles, the number of points where three circles intersect is 15(14)(13)/6 = 455. However, we need to remember that each point is counted three times (once for each circle), so we need to divide this number by 3 to get the actual number of points. \n\nTherefore, the number of points where three circles intersect is 455/3 = 151.67. But again, we cannot have a fraction of a point, so we need to round this down to the nearest whole number, which is 151. \n\nFinally, we add the number of points where two circles intersect (52) to the number of points where three circles intersect (151) to get the total number of points with which the circles intersect: \n\n52 + 151 = 203 \n\nHowever, we need to remember that some of these points may be counted multiple times (for example, a point where four circles intersect will be counted four times). \n\nTo find the actual number of distinct points of intersection, we need to subtract the number of points that are counted multiple times. \n\nFor example, the number of points where four circles intersect can be calculated using the formula n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)/24, where n is the number of circles. \n\nSo, for 15 circles, the number of points where four circles intersect is 15(14)(13)(12)/24 = 1365. However, we need to remember that each point is counted four times (once for each circle), so we need to divide this number by 4 to get the actual number of points. \n\nTherefore, the number of points where four circles intersect is 1365/4 = 341.25. But again, we cannot have a fraction of a point, so we need to round this down to the nearest whole number, which is 341. \n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the number of points where five circles intersect, six circles intersect, and so on. \n\nAfter subtracting all the points that are counted multiple times, we get the final answer: \n\n203 - 23 - 341 - 1 = 180 \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of points with which the circles intersect is 180, which is option D.",

        "Response": "Let's start by finding the composition of chemical X and chemical Y.\n\nChemical X is prepared by mixing A and B in the ratio of 1:3, so for every 4 units of chemical X, we have 1 unit of A and 3 units of B.\n\nChemical Y is prepared by mixing B and C in the ratio of 2:1, so for every 9 units of chemical Y, we have 6 units of B and 3 units of C.\n\nTo make 9 units of product M, we need 5 units of X and 4 units of Y. Therefore, we need:\n\n5 units of X = 5/4 * 4 units of B = 5 units of B and 5/4 * 1 unit of A = 5/4 units of A\n4 units of Y = 4/9 * 6 units of B = 8/3 units of B and 4/9 * 3 units of C = 4/3 units of C\n\nSo for every 9 units of product M, we have 5 units of B, 5/4 units of A, 8/3 units of B, and 4/3 units of C.\n\nNow let's consider the final mixture. We have 864 units of product M, which means we have:\n\n864/9 * 5 units of B = 480 units of B\n864/9 * 5/4 units of A = 135 units of A\n864/9 * 8/3 units of B = 256 units of B\n864/9 * 4/3 units of C = 192 units of C\n\nWe know that the concentration of B in the final mixture is 50%, which means the total amount of the final mixture is twice the amount of B. Therefore, we have:\n\n480 units of B = 1/2 * (480 + 135 + 256 + 192 + water)\nSolving for water, we get:\n\nwater = 2 * 480 - (480 + 135 + 256 + 192) = 328\n\nTherefore, the answer is {328}.",

",
        "Response": "Answer: {A) With the exception of 1 instance, p will be equal to q}\n\nExplanation:\nLet's assume that the percentage increase in the number of livestock in year 2000 was p%. Therefore, the number of livestock at the end of year 2000 would be:\n\n130,000 + (p/100)*130,000 = 130,000*(1 + p/100)\n\nNow, in year 2001, the number of livestock decreased by q%. Therefore, the number of livestock at the end of year 2001 would be:\n\n130,000*(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100)\n\nWe are given that the number of livestock at the end of year 2001 was 130,000. Therefore, we can write:\n\n130,000*(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100) = 130,000\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(1 + p/100)*(1 - q/100) = 1\n\n1 - (p/100)*(q/100) = 1\n\n(p/100)*(q/100) = 0\n\nThis equation tells us that either p = 0 or q = 0 or both. If either p or q is equal to 0, then there is no increase or decrease in the number of livestock, which contradicts the fact that the number of livestock remained constant at 130,000. Therefore, we can conclude that p and q are both non-zero.\n\nNow, let's assume that p > q. This means that the percentage increase in the number of livestock in year 2000 was greater than the percentage decrease in year 2001. Therefore, the number of livestock at the end of year 2001 would be greater than 130,000, which contradicts the fact that the number of livestock remained constant at 130,000. Therefore, we can conclude that p cannot be greater than q.\n\nSimilarly, we can show that q cannot be greater than p. Therefore, the only possibility left is that p = q, except for the case where both p and q are equal to 0, which we have already ruled out. Therefore, the correct option is A) With the exception of 1 instance, p will be equal to q.",

is given by: \n\u230a100/5\u230b + \u230a100/25\u230b + \u230a100/125\u230b + \u230a100/625\u230b = 20 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 25 \n(Note: \u230ax\u230b denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x) \n\nThe number of factors of 3 in 100!

is determined by the number of factors of 5, which is 25. \nTherefore, the greatest possible value of n is \u230a25/2\u230b = 12. \nHowever, we also need to check if there are any additional factors of 5 that come from the even numbers in 100!. \nThe number of even numbers in 100!

        "Response": "Let's assume that a pound of raisins costs $x$.

        "Response": "Let's call the distance Otto drives in the first 1.5 hours \"d\". Since he drives at a speed of x miles per hour, we know that:\n\nd = x * 1.5\n\nSimilarly, let's call the distance Han drives in the first 1.5 hours \"e\". We don't know Han's speed, so we'll call it \"y\" for now:\n\ne = y * 1.5\n\nWhen they are driving toward each other, their combined distance traveled is 40 miles. So we can set up an equation:\n\nd + e = 40\n\nSubstituting in our expressions for d and e:\n\nx * 1.5 + y * 1.5 = 40\n\nSimplifying:\n\n1.5(x + y) = 40\n\nx + y = 26.67\n\nNow let's look at what happens in the next 1.5 hours, when they are driving away from each other. Otto will have driven an additional 1.5x miles, and Han will have driven an additional 1.5y miles. So their combined distance will be:\n\n40 + 1.5x + 1.5y\n\nWe know that this distance is also equal to the distance they were apart when they were driving toward each other, which was 40 miles. So we can set up another equation:\n\n40 + 1.5x + 1.5y = 40\n\nSimplifying:\n\n1.5x + 1.5y = 0\n\nx + y = 0\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nx + y = 26.67\n\nx + y = 0\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n0 = 26.67\n\nThis is obviously not true, so there must be an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nAh, we made a mistake when we set up the equation for the distance they traveled when driving away from each other. We forgot to subtract the distance they had already traveled toward each other. So the correct equation is:\n\n40 + 1.5x + 1.5y = 40 + d + e - 40\n\nSimplifying:\n\n1.5x + 1.5y = 1.5x + 1.5y\n\nThis is true, but not very helpful. Let's try a different approach. We know that when they are driving away from each other, their combined distance is increasing at a rate of (x + y) miles per hour. So we can set up an equation:\n\n40 + 1.5(x + y) = 40 + (x + y) * t\n\nwhere t is the additional time they drive away from each other. We know that t is also 1.5 hours, so we can simplify:\n\n40 + 1.5(x + y) = 40 + 1.5(x + y)\n\nThis is true, but again not very helpful. Let's try one more approach. We know that when they are driving away from each other, their combined speed is (x + y) miles per hour. We also know that their combined distance is increasing at a rate of 40 miles per 1.5 hours. So we can set up an equation:\n\n(x + y) * t = 40\n\nwhere t is the time they are driving away from each other. We know that t is 1.5 hours, so we can simplify:\n\n(x + y) * 1.5 = 40\n\n1.5x + 1.5y = 40\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nx + y = 26.67\n\n1.5x + 1.5y = 40\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 1.5, we get:\n\n1.5x + 1.5y = 40.005\n\nSubtracting the second equation from this, we get:\n\n0.005x - 0.005 = 0.005\n\nx = 1\n\nSo Otto drives at a speed of 1 mile per hour. Substituting this into our first equation:\n\n1 + y = 26.67\n\ny = 25.67\n\nSo Han drives at a speed of 25.67 miles per hour.\n\nAnswer: {25.67}.",

The angle between them is 90 degrees.\nIn 45 minutes, the minute hand moves 45/60 = 3/4 of the way around the clock face, or 270 degrees.\nIn 45 minutes, the hour hand moves 45/60 * 1/12 of the way around the clock face, or 11.25 degrees.\nSo the angle between the hands at 3:45 is 270 - 11.25 = 258.75 degrees.\nHowever, we want the acute angle between the hands, which is 360 - 258.75 = 101.25 degrees.\nSince the hour hand is slightly past the 3 and the minute hand is between the 8 and 9, we need to add half of the angle between the hour markers 3 and 4, which is 30/2 = 15 degrees.\nSo the final answer is 101.25 + 15 = 116.25 degrees, which simplifies to {112 1/2 degree}.",

        "Response": "Option D) 12x10/11 {Answer}\n\nExplanation:\nBetween 8 and 9 o'clock, the hour hand moves from 8 to 9 while the minute hand moves from 12 to 9 (as the minute hand moves faster than the hour hand). Let's assume that the hands of the clock form a straight line at x minutes past 8 o'clock.\n\nAt x minutes past 8 o'clock, the hour hand would have moved (8 + x/60) hours and the minute hand would have moved x minutes.\n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock mark is (30 \u00d7 (8 + x/60)) degrees, and the angle between the minute hand and the 12 o'clock mark is (6 \u00d7 x) degrees.\n\nFor the hands to be in a straight line, these angles must either add up to 180 degrees or differ by 180 degrees.\n\nSo, we have two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: The angles add up to 180 degrees\n(30 \u00d7 (8 + x/60)) + (6 \u00d7 x) = 180\nSolving for x, we get x = 132/11 minutes past 8 o'clock.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this value is between 0 and 60 (as x represents minutes). Since 132/11 is greater than 11, this case is not valid.\n\nCase 2: The angles differ by 180 degrees\n(30 \u00d7 (8 + x/60)) - (6 \u00d7 x) = 180\nSolving for x, we get x = 120/11 minutes past 8 o'clock.\n\nAgain, we need to check if this value is between 0 and 60. Since 120/11 is less than 11, this case is valid.\n\nTherefore, the hands of the clock will be in the same straight line but not together at approximately 10x/11 minutes past 8 o'clock.\n\nConverting this to the nearest minute, we get x = 109.09, which is approximately 109 minutes past 8 o'clock.\n\nAdding this to 8 o'clock, we get the final answer of 9:49 (in terms of minutes past 8 o'clock).\n\nConverting this to the 12-hour clock format, we get the final answer of 12x10/11, which is option D.",

Let P be the number of spiders Pugsley has and W be the number of spiders Wednesday has before the trade. \nFrom the first sentence, we know that:\nW + 4 = 4(P - 4)\nW + 4 = 4P - 16\nW = 4P - 20\nFrom the second sentence, we know that:\nP + 5 = W - 5\nP = W - 10\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\nW - 10 = 4P - 20\nW = 4P - 10\nNow we have two equations for W, so we can set them equal to each other:\n4P - 20 = 4P - 10\n10 = 20\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution where Pugsley gives Wednesday four spiders and Wednesday has four times as many spiders as Pugsley. Therefore, we made a mistake somewhere. Let's check the equations:\nW + 4 = 4(P - 4)\nW + 4 = 4P - 16\nW = 4P - 20\nP + 5 = W - 5\nP = W - 10\nThe mistake is in the first equation.

Therefore, we made another mistake somewhere. Let's check the equations again:\nW + 4 = 4(P - 4) - 4\nW + 4 = 4P - 20\nW = 4P - 24\nP + 5 = W - 5\nP = W - 10\nThe mistake is in the second equation.

Therefore, the only solution is the initial state where Pugsley and Wednesday have the same number of spiders.

What was the bookstore\u2019s net percent profit or loss on the entire lot of 400 books?\nOptions:  A)30% loss B)10% loss C)10% profit D)20% profit E)60% profit Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide the answer followed by the explanation.. ",
        "Response": "Option D) 20% profit {120}\n\nExplanation:\nThe store bought 400 copies at wholesale price W, so the total cost of the books was 400W.\n\nThe store sold the first 150 copies at 80% more than W, which means they sold each book at 1.8W. So, the revenue from the first 150 books was 150 x 1.8W = 270W.\n\nThe store sold the next 100 copies at 20% more than W, which means they sold each book at 1.2W. So, the revenue from the next 100 books was 100 x 1.2W = 120W.\n\nThe store sold the remaining 150 copies to a bargain retailer at 40% less than W, which means they sold each book at 0.6W. So, the revenue from the remaining 150 books was 150 x 0.6W = 90W.\n\nThe total revenue from selling all 400 books was 270W + 120W + 90W = 480W.\n\nThe profit made by the store was the revenue minus the cost, which is 480W - 400W = 80W.\n\nThe percent profit is (profit/cost) x 100%, which is (80W/400W) x 100% = 20%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 20% profit {120}.",

However, since each table can be paired with any of the 4 chairs, we need to divide by 4! (the number of ways to arrange 4 items) to get the number of unique combinations.

        "Response": "{Answer: D)187 m}\n\nWe know that the train's length is 500 m and it crosses a tunnel in 1 minute. Let's convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s for easier calculations.\n\n78 km/hr = (78 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 21.67 m/s\n\nLet the length of the tunnel be x meters. During the time the train crosses the tunnel, it travels a distance equal to the sum of its own length and the length of the tunnel.\n\nDistance = 500 + x\n\nTime = 1 minute = 60 seconds\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\n21.67 = (500 + x) / 60\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60, we get:\n\n1300.2 = 500 + x\n\nSubtracting 500 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 800.2\n\nTherefore, the length of the tunnel is 800.2 meters. However, we need to subtract the length of the train from this value to get the actual length of the tunnel.\n\nActual length of the tunnel = 800.2 - 500 = 300.2 meters\n\nBut we need to give our answer in meters, rounded to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 300 meters.\n\nHowever, none of the answer options match this value. The closest option is D)187 m, which is significantly smaller than our calculated value. This means that we made an error in our calculations. Let's check our work.\n\nWe can see that our mistake was in assuming that the train's speed was constant throughout the entire journey. In reality, the train slows down when it enters the tunnel and speeds up again when it exits. Therefore, our calculation of the length of the tunnel based on a constant speed was incorrect.\n\nTo correct our mistake, we need to use a different approach. We know that the train takes 1 minute to cross the tunnel, which means that it takes 30 seconds to cover the distance from the beginning of the tunnel to the end of the tunnel. During this time, the train travels a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the tunnel.\n\nDistance = 500 + x\n\nTime = 30 seconds\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nConverting the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s:\n\n78 km/hr = (78 x 1000) / (60 x 60) m/s = 21.67 m/s\n\n21.67 = (500 + x) / 30\n\nMultiplying both sides by 30, we get:\n\n650.1 = 500 + x\n\nSubtracting 500 from both sides, we get:\n\nx = 150.1\n\nTherefore, the length of the tunnel is approximately 150 meters.\n\nRounding this value to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n{Answer: D)187 m}",

        "Response": "{120}\n\nLet's assume that the initial number of persons in building P is x and in building Q is y.\nAccording to the first condition, if 15 persons are sent from P to Q, then the number of persons in each building is the same. So, after the transfer, the number of persons in each building will be (x-15) and (y+15) respectively.\nAccording to the second condition, if 20 persons are sent from Q to P, then the number of persons in P is double the number of persons in Q. So, after the transfer, the number of persons in each building will be (x+20) and (y-20) respectively, and we have:\n\nx+20 = 2(y-20)\n\nx+20 = 2y-40\n\nx = 2y-60\n\nNow, we can equate the number of persons in each building after the first transfer:\n\nx-15 = y+15\n\nx = y+30\n\nSubstituting the value of x from the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\n2y-60 = y+30-15\n\ny = 45\n\nTherefore, the initial number of persons in building P was x = 2y-60 = 2(45)-60 = 30, and after the transfers, the number of persons in building P is x+20 = 30+20 = 50.\n\nHence, the answer is {120}.",

How many outcomes W of the competition are possible?\nOptions:  A)18 B)20 C)54 D)84 E)120 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide the answer followed by the explanation.. ",
        "Response": "We can use complementary counting to solve this problem. First, we find the total number of outcomes, which is simply the number of ways to award three prizes to six teams, which is $6\\times5\\times4=120$. \n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of outcomes where neither Team A nor Team B wins a prize. There are four prizes left to award to six teams, so there are $6\\times5\\times4\\times3=360$ ways to award the prizes without considering the restriction on Team A and Team B. \n\nIf neither Team A nor Team B wins a prize, then the three prizes must be awarded to the other four teams. There are ${4\\choose3}=4$ ways to choose which three teams win prizes, and $3!=6$ ways to assign the prizes to those teams. Therefore, there are $4\\times6=24$ outcomes where neither Team A nor Team B wins a prize. \n\nSo, the number of outcomes where either Team A or Team B wins a prize is $120-24=96$. However, we have overcounted the outcomes where both Team A and Team B win prizes. There are two prizes left to award to four teams, so there are $4\\times3=12$ ways to award the prizes to the other teams. Therefore, there are $96-12=84$ outcomes where either Team A or Team B wins a prize but not both. \n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\{84\\}}$.",

Then, the probability of selecting another red chip on the second draw (without replacement) is 3/7 (since there are now only 3 red chips left out of 7 total chips). Therefore, the probability of selecting two red chips is (4/8) * (3/7) = 3/14. \n\nSimilarly, if we choose blue, the probability of selecting two blue chips is also 3/14. \n\nTo find the probability of selecting two chips of different colors, we can subtract the probability of selecting two chips of the same color from 1. \n\nSo, P(different colors) = 1 - P(same color) = 1 - (3/14 + 3/14) = 1 - 6/14 = 8/14 = 4/7. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {C) 7/12}.",

        "Response": "We have [6.5] = 6 and [2/3] = 0 (since the greatest integer less than or equal to any fraction between 0 and 1 is 0).

        "Response": "{125\u00b0} \n\nExplanation: \n\nAt 3:00, the hour hand is at the 3 and the minute hand is at the 12. The angle between them is 90\u00b0. \n\nFrom 3:00 to 3:40, the hour hand moves a fraction of the way between the 3 and the 4. There are 12 hour marks on a clock, so each hour mark represents 30\u00b0 (360\u00b0/12). \n\nTherefore, from 3:00 to 3:40, the hour hand moves 40/60 of the way between the 3 and the 4, which is 2/3 of the way. So, the hour hand moves 2/3 of 30\u00b0, which is 20\u00b0. \n\nAt 3:40, the hour hand is at the 3 plus 20\u00b0, which is at the 4. \n\nThe minute hand moves from the 12 to the 8 (since 40 minutes have passed), which is 8/12 of the way around the clock. There are 60 minute marks on a clock, so each minute mark represents 6\u00b0 (360\u00b0/60). \n\nTherefore, the minute hand moves 8/12 of 360\u00b0, which is 240\u00b0. \n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is the difference between their positions, which is 240\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 (since the hour hand is at the 4, which is 120\u00b0 from the 12). \n\n240\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 120\u00b0 \n\nTherefore, the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:40 is 120\u00b0. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the acute angle between the hour hand and the minute hand, which is 360\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 240\u00b0. \n\nBut since the answer choices only give acute angles, we need to subtract 240\u00b0 from 360\u00b0 to get the acute angle between the hour hand and the minute hand: \n\n360\u00b0 - 240\u00b0 = 120\u00b0 \n\nTherefore, the answer is {125\u00b0} (the closest acute angle to 120\u00b0 in the answer choices).",

        "Response": "{D)$70} \n\nLet's assume that the selling price of each key chain was $x before the decrease in manufacturing cost. \n\nInitially, the profit from the sale of each key chain was 30% of $x, which is 0.3x. \n\nAfter the decrease in manufacturing cost, the profit from the sale of each key chain increased to 50% of $x, which is 0.5x. \n\nWe know that the manufacturing cost is now $50. \n\nSo, the equation becomes: \n\n0.5x - $50 = $x - $50 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n0.5x - x = - $50 + $50 \n\n-0.5x = 0 \n\nx = 0 \n\nThis doesn't make sense, so we need to check our work. \n\nLet's try another approach. \n\nWe know that the profit increased from 30% to 50%. \n\nSo, the profit increased by 20% of the selling price. \n\nWe can set up an equation using this information: \n\n0.2x = $50 \n\nSolving for x, we get: \n\nx = $250 \n\nThis means that the manufacturing cost before the decrease was: \n\n$250 - 50 = $200 \n\nTherefore, the answer is {D)$70}.",

        "Response": "{C) 2/3 hours} \n\nLet's first calculate the distance covered by the thief in half an hour at a speed of 22 kmph:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 22 x 0.5\nDistance = 11 km\n\nNow, let's assume that the owner overtakes the thief after t hours from the start. In this time, the thief would have covered a distance of:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 22t + 11\n\nSimilarly, the owner would have covered a distance of:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 72t\n\nNow, we know that the owner overtakes the thief at this point. Therefore, the distance covered by both of them would be the same. Hence, we can equate the two distances:\n\n72t = 22t + 11\n50t = 11\nt = 11/50 hours\n\nTherefore, the owner will overtake the thief after 11/50 hours from the start, which is approximately equal to {C) 2/3 hours}.",

Then the amount of silver in the bar is (30-x) kg. \n\nFrom the given information, we know that: \n\n- 10 kg of tin loses 1.375 kg in water, so x kg of tin loses (1.375/10)*x = 0.1375x kg in water. \n- 5 kg of silver loses 0.375 kg in water, so (30-x) kg of silver loses (0.375/5)*(30-x) = 0.075(30-x) kg in water. \n\nThe total weight lost in water is 3 kg, so: \n\n0.1375x + 0.075(30-x) = 3 \n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get: \n\n0.1375x + 2.25 - 0.075x = 3 \n\n0.0625x = 0.75 \n\nx = 12 \n\nTherefore, the bar contains 12 kg of tin and 18 kg of silver, and the ratio of tin to silver is 12:18, which simplifies to 2:3. \n\nAnswer: {2:3}",

        "Response": "{D)260 metre} \n\nWe can start by converting the speed of the train from kmph to m/s: \n\n72 kmph = 20 m/s \n\nNext, we can use the formula: \n\ndistance = speed x time \n\nLet's let x be the length of the train. The train will travel the length of the platform (250m) plus the length of the train (x) in the time it takes to cross the platform. So: \n\ndistance = 250m + x \n\nspeed = 20 m/s \n\ntime = 26 seconds \n\nPlugging in these values, we get: \n\n250 + x = 20 x 26 \n\nSimplifying: \n\n250 + x = 520 \n\nx = 270 \n\nTherefore, the length of the train is 270 meters. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We need to remember that the question is asking for the length of the train only, not the total distance traveled.

        "Response": "{D)7800}\nLet's assume that the man was x meters away from the site when he heard the first blast. Since the speed of sound is 330 m/s, the sound would have traveled a distance of 330 * 1800 = 594000 meters in 30 minutes (1800 seconds) after the first blast. Therefore, the man would have been at a distance of (x + 594000) meters from the site when he heard the second blast. \n\nNow, we know that the second blast occurred exactly 30 minutes after the first blast. This means that the man heard the second blast after (30 mins 20 secs - 30 mins) = 20 seconds. In these 20 seconds, the sound would have traveled a distance of 330 * 20 = 6600 meters. \n\nTherefore, the total distance between the man and the site when he heard the second blast would be (x + 594000 + 6600) meters. \n\nSince the man was driving at a constant speed, we can use the formula: \n\ndistance = speed * time \n\nLet's assume that the man drove for t seconds after he heard the first blast and before he heard the second blast.

",
        "Response": "{E) 300 m} \n\nLet's assume that the thief runs for 't' minutes before he is overtaken by the policeman. \n\nDistance covered by the thief in 't' minutes = Speed of the thief x Time taken \n= (8 km/hr) x (t/60) hr \n= (8t/60) km \n= (4t/30) km \n= (2t/15) km \n\nDistance covered by the policeman in 't' minutes = Speed of the policeman x Time taken \n= (10 km/hr) x (t/60) hr \n= (10t/60) km \n= (t/6) km \n\nNow, we know that the distance between the thief and the policeman was initially 100 metres or 0.1 km. \n\nSo, after 't' minutes, the distance between them would have reduced to: \n\n0.1 km - [(2t/15) km - (t/6) km] \n= 0.1 km - [(4t - 15t)/90] km \n= 0.1 km - (11t/90) km \n\nWe want to find out the value of 't' when the distance between them becomes zero, i.e., when the policeman overtakes the thief. \n\n0.1 km - (11t/90) km = 0 \n11t/90 = 0.1 \nt = (0.1 x 90)/11 \nt = 0.818 minutes \n\nNow, we can substitute this value of 't' in the equation for the distance covered by the thief: \n\nDistance covered by the thief = (2t/15) km \n= (2 x 0.818)/15 km \n= 0.109 km \n= 109 metres \n\nTherefore, the thief would have run for 109 metres before he is overtaken by the policeman. \n\nHowever, we need to add the initial distance between them (100 metres) to get the total distance covered by the thief: \n\nTotal distance covered by the thief = 109 metres + 100 metres \n= 209 metres \n\nBut, we need to convert this to kilometres: \n\nTotal distance covered by the thief = 209/1000 km \n= 0.209 km \n\nRounding off to the nearest hundredth, we get: \n\nTotal distance covered by the thief = 0.21 km \n\nTherefore, the answer is {E) 300 m}.",

Therefore,\nV1/V2 = (r1^3)/(r2^3)   ...(1)\nAlso, we are given that V1/V2 = 1/10.

We know that the lengths of the wires required to make the two cones are proportional to their slant heights. Therefore,\nLength of wire required for cone 1/Length of wire required for cone 2 = h1/h2\nWe can find h1 and h2 using the Pythagorean theorem:\nh1^2 = r1^2 + (r1/2)^2 = 5r1^2/4\nh2^2 = r2^2 + (r2/2)^2 = 5r2^2/4\nDividing these equations, we get:\nh1^2/h2^2 = r1^2/r2^2 = (r1/r2)^2 = 1/4\nTaking square root on both sides, we get:\nh1/h2 = 1/2\nTherefore, Length of wire required for cone 1/Length of wire required for cone 2 = 1/2\nHence, the ratio of the lengths of wire required to make the two cones is 2:4, which simplifies to 1:2.

        "Response": "{72}\nFirst, we can seat Mary in one of the six chairs and fix her position. Then, we can seat the three females in the remaining three chairs, which can be done in 3! = 6 ways. Finally, we can seat the three males in the remaining three chairs such that no two males sit next to each other. This can be done using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let A be the set of all possible seatings, and let Ai be the set of seatings where the ith pair of males sit next to each other. Then, by inclusion-exclusion, the number of seatings where no two males sit next to each other is:\n\n|A| - |A1 \u222a A2 \u222a A3| + |A1 \u2229 A2| + |A1 \u2229 A3| + |A2 \u2229 A3| - |A1 \u2229 A2 \u2229 A3|\n\nwhere |S| denotes the number of elements in set S. Note that |A| = 3! = 6, |A1| = |A2| = |A3| = 2!, |A1 \u2229 A2| = |A1 \u2229 A3| = |A2 \u2229 A3| = 1!, and |A1 \u2229 A2 \u2229 A3| = 0. Therefore, the number of seatings where no two males sit next to each other is:\n\n6 - (2! + 2! + 2!) + (1! + 1! + 1!) - 0 = 3\n\nThus, the total number of valid seatings is 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3 = 108. However, since the table is circular, each seating is counted six times (once for each possible starting position). Therefore, the actual number of valid seatings is 108/6 = 18. Finally, since Mary's position is fixed, the answer is 18.",

",
        "Response": "{<<3>>C} \n\nLet's assume that the capacities of the four barrels are a, b, c, and Q, where Q is the smallest barrel. We know that the average capacity of the four barrels is 8 gallons, so:\n\n(a + b + c + Q)/4 = 8\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n\na + b + c + Q = 32\n\nWe also know that the median capacity is 10 gallons. Since there are four barrels, the median is the average of the two middle values. This means that either (b + c)/2 = 10 or (a + Q)/2 = 10. We can simplify these equations to:\n\nb + c = 20 or a + Q = 20\n\nNow we need to find the maximum possible value of Q. We know that Q is the smallest barrel, so its capacity must be less than or equal to the other three barrels. This means that Q <= a, Q <= b, and Q <= c. We can use these inequalities to solve for Q:\n\na + Q = 20\nQ <= a\nTherefore, Q <= 10\n\nb + Q = 20\nQ <= b\nTherefore, Q <= 10\n\nc + Q = 20\nQ <= c\nTherefore, Q <= 10\n\nSince Q is the smallest barrel, its capacity must be as large as possible while still satisfying these inequalities. The largest possible value of Q is therefore 10 - 3 = 7. We can check that this value works by plugging it into our equations:\n\na + Q = 20\nb + c = 20\nQ <= a, Q <= b, Q <= c\n\nIf we let a = 10, b = 10, and c = 10, then Q = 7 satisfies all of these conditions.

",
        "Response": "{D)675}\n\nLet's start by finding out how many parts were planned to be produced. If the company makes 25 parts a day and works for 3 days, then the planned production is:\n\nPlanned production = 25 parts/day x 3 days = 75 parts\n\nNow we know that the company produced 100 more parts than planned. Let's call the total number of parts produced \"x\". We can set up an equation to solve for \"x\":\n\nx = 75 + 100\nx = 175\n\nSo the company produced 175 parts in total. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many days it took to produce these parts. The company made 25 parts a day for the first 3 days, and then started making 5 more parts per day. Let's call the number of days the company made 25 parts per day \"d\", and the number of days the company made 30 parts per day \"e\". We can set up two equations to solve for \"d\" and \"e\":\n\n25d + 30e = 175  (total number of parts produced)\nd + e = 6  (total number of days worked)\n\nWe can solve for \"d\" by rearranging the second equation:\n\nd = 6 - e\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n25(6 - e) + 30e = 175\n150 - 25e + 30e = 175\n5e = 25\ne = 5\n\nSo the company made 25 parts per day for 3 days, and then made 30 parts per day for 5 days. The total number of days worked is:\n\nTotal days = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nTherefore, the company made 175 parts in 8 days. \n\nThe answer is {D)675}.",

        "Response": "{D) Y Beats X by 10m}\n\nIn the first race, X runs 100m and Y runs 80m (since X beats Y by 20m). \n\nIn the second race, X starts 10m behind the starting line, so X runs 110m while Y runs 100m. \n\nSince both run at the same previous speed, we can set up the following equation: \n\n100/speed of Y = 110/speed of X \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n10/speed of Y = 11/speed of X \n\nSince the speeds are the same in both races, we can set them equal to each other: \n\nspeed of X = speed of Y \n\nSubstituting this into the equation above, we get: \n\n10/speed of Y = 11/speed of Y \n\nSolving for the speed of Y, we get: \n\nspeed of Y = 10k \n\nwhere k is some constant. \n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the first race, we get: \n\n100/10k = 80/10k + 20 \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\n10/k = 6 \n\nSo k = 10/6. \n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the speed of Y, we get: \n\nspeed of Y = 10/6 \n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the speed of X, we get: \n\nspeed of X = 10/6 \n\nNow we can calculate how far each person runs in the second race: \n\nX runs (110)(10/6) = 183.33m \n\nY runs (100)(10/6) = 166.67m \n\nTherefore, Y beats X by 183.33 - 166.67 = 16.67m, which we round to 10m (since the answer choices are in whole numbers). \n\nTherefore, the answer is {D) Y Beats X by 10m}.",

Therefore, we need to add the time taken for the 3 detached boggies to cross the telegraph post as well. Since each boggy is 15 meters long and the speed of the train is 20 m/s, each boggy will take 15/20 = 0.75 seconds to cross the telegraph post. Since 3 boggies were detached, the total time taken for them to cross the telegraph post is 3 x 0.75 = 2.25 seconds.\nAdding this to the time taken for the remaining part of the train to cross the telegraph post, we get:\nt = 6.75 + 2.25 = 9 seconds\nTherefore, the train now crosses the telegraph post in 9 seconds.",

        "Query": "A certain university will select 3 of 7 candidates eligible to fill a position in the mathematics department and 5 of 8 candidates eligible to fill 2 identical positions in the computer science department. If none of the candidates is eligible for a position in both departments, how many different sets of 3 candidates are there to fill the 3 positions?\nOptions:  A)42232 B)42170 C)14008 D)16510 E)41160 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide the answer followed by the explanation.. ",
        "Response": "The number of ways to select 3 candidates from 7 is given by the combination ${7 \\choose 3} = 35$. Similarly, the number of ways to select 5 candidates from 8 is given by the combination ${8 \\choose 5} = 56$. Since the two selections are independent, the total number of ways to select 3 candidates for the mathematics department and 5 candidates for the computer science department is $35 \\times 56 = 1960$. \n\nTo count the number of different sets of 3 candidates to fill the 3 positions, we need to consider the number of ways to distribute the selected candidates among the two departments. There are two cases to consider: \n\nCase 1: All 3 candidates are selected for the mathematics department. In this case, there is only one way to fill the computer science positions, namely by selecting any 5 candidates from the remaining 4. Therefore, there are ${7 \\choose 3} \\times {4 \\choose 5} = 35$ different sets of candidates in this case. \n\nCase 2: 2 candidates are selected for the mathematics department and 1 candidate is selected for the computer science department. In this case, there are ${7 \\choose 2}$ ways to select the 2 candidates for the mathematics department and ${8 \\choose 1}$ ways to select the candidate for the computer science department. The remaining 4 candidates are not eligible for the computer science department, so we must select 4 candidates from the remaining 5 to fill the second computer science position. Therefore, there are ${7 \\choose 2} \\times {8 \\choose 1} \\times {5 \\choose 4} = 980$ different sets of candidates in this case. \n\nThe total number of different sets of 3 candidates to fill the 3 positions is the sum of the number of sets in each case, which is $35 + 980 = 1015$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\{1015\\}}$.",

We can rearrange this to get $x/3=2y/3$, or $x=2y$. \n\nWe also know that it takes 1.2 times as long to produce a deluxe stereo as it does to produce a basic stereo.

",
        "Response": "{5/8} is the correct answer. \n\nThere are two possible scenarios in which we can pick two balls of different colors: we can either pick a white ball first and then a red ball, or we can pick a red ball first and then a white ball. \n\nThe probability of picking a white ball first is 5/9, since there are 5 white balls out of 9 total balls in the bag. After we pick a white ball, there are 4 red balls left out of 8 total balls, so the probability of picking a red ball second is 4/8. Therefore, the probability of picking a white ball first and then a red ball is (5/9) x (4/8) = 5/18. \n\nSimilarly, the probability of picking a red ball first and then a white ball is (4/9) x (5/8) = 5/18. \n\nSince these are the only two possible scenarios in which we can pick two balls of different colors, we can add their probabilities to get the total probability: \n\n(5/18) + (5/18) = 10/18 = 5/9 \n\nHowever, the question asks for the probability as a fraction in simplest form, so we need to simplify 5/9.

        "Response": "Answer: {-50}\n\nExplanation:\nThe sequence alternates between positive and negative terms. The sum of the first 200 terms can be split into two parts: the sum of the positive terms and the sum of the negative terms. \n\nThe positive terms are 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 399. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2 and 100 terms. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the positive terms is:\n\n(1 + 399)/2 * 100 = 20000\n\nThe negative terms are -2, -4, -6, ..., -398. This is also an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -2 and 100 terms. The sum of this sequence is:\n\n(-2 + (-398))/2 * 100 = -20000\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 200 terms is 0, and the average is 0/200 = 0. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the average of the first 200 terms of the sequence, not the sum. Since there are 100 positive terms and 100 negative terms, the average of the first 200 terms is the average of 100 and -2, which is:\n\n(100 - 2)/2 = 49\n\nBut the answer choices are in the form of fractions, so we need to express 49 as a fraction. 49/1 = 98/2, so the answer is:\n\n{-50} (since -50 is the only answer choice in the form of a fraction with a denominator of 2)",

        "Response": "Answer: {D}\nExplanation: \nWe know that 180/x and 108/x are integers, which means that x must be a factor of both 180 and 108. The factors of 180 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, and 180. The factors of 108 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, and 108. The common factors of both are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. \n\nI. 9/x is an integer: Since 9 is a factor of 36, which is a common factor of both 180 and 108, 9/x must also be an integer. Therefore, option I is true.\n\nII. 12/x is an integer: Since 12 is a factor of 36, which is a common factor of both 180 and 108, 12/x must also be an integer. Therefore, option II is true.\n\nIII. 36/x is an integer: Since 36 is a common factor of both 180 and 108, 36/x must also be an integer. Therefore, option III is true.\n\nHence, the correct option is {D}.",

        "Response": "{D) 6 hours} \n\nLet's assume that the distance between the two points is \"d\" and the man's walking speed is \"w\" and his riding speed is \"r\". \n\nAccording to the problem, \n\nTime taken to walk one way + Time taken to ride back = 6 1/4 hours \n\nd/w + d/r = 6 1/4 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n4d/4w + 5d/4r = 25/4 \n\nMultiplying both sides by 4wr, we get: \n\n16d + 20d = 25wr \n\n36d = 25wr \n\nSimilarly, \n\nTime taken to walk both ways = 7 3/4 hours \n\n2d/w = 7 3/4 \n\nMultiplying both sides by w, we get: \n\n2d = 15 1/4 w \n\nNow, we need to find the time taken to ride both ways, which we can represent as: \n\n2d/r = t \n\nSubstituting the value of \"d\" from the second equation into the third equation, we get: \n\n2(15 1/4 w)/36w = t \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\nt = 6 hours \n\nTherefore, the answer is {D) 6 hours}.",

Let's use the same formula: \n\nnumber of days = (total work) / (rate of work) \n\nWe know that the total work is still 1, but the rate of work will be different for 20 men: \n\nrate of work for 20 men = (total work) / (number of days) \n\nWe don't know the number of days yet, but we can solve for it by setting the two rates of work equal to each other: \n\nrate of work for 14 men = rate of work for 20 men \n\n1/80 = (1) / (number of days for 20 men) \n\nSolving for the number of days: \n\nnumber of days for 20 men = (80) / (14/20) = 56 \n\nTherefore, 20 men can do the same work in 56 days.",

        "Response": "Let's call the median integer x. Since there are 5 integers and t is the largest, we know that x must be either the third or fourth largest integer. \n\nIf x is the third largest integer, then we know that k, m, and x are less than 10 (since their average is 10), and t is 20. Therefore, r and s must have an average of 20 as well. We can set up an equation: \n\n(r + s)/2 = 20 \n\nSince r < s, we know that r must be less than 20 and s must be greater than 20. The largest possible value of r is 19 (since it must be an integer and less than 20), which means the largest possible value of x is 18. \n\nIf x is the fourth largest integer, then we know that k, m, r, and x are less than 10 (since their average is 10), and t is 20.

Then the equation becomes:\n\n4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n16x = 1464\n\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\nx = 91\n\nBut we know that F, O, and G are all digits in a three-digit number, so x can't be greater than 9. Therefore, we need to try a different approach.\n\nLet's assume that F and O are the same digit, which we'll call x, and that G is a different digit, which we'll call y. Then the equation becomes:\n\n2x + 2x + 2y + 2y = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4x + 4y = 1464\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nx + y = 366\n\nBut we know that F, O, and G are all digits in a three-digit number, so x and y can't be greater than 9. Therefore, we need to try a different approach.\n\nLet's assume that F is a different digit, which we'll call x, and that O and G are the same digit, which we'll call y. Then the equation becomes:\n\nx + 3y + x + 3y + x + 3y + x + 3y = 1464\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n4x + 12y = 1464\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\nx + 3y = 366\n\nNow we can see that x and y can be digits between 1 and 9 that add up to 3, 6, or 9. The only combination that works is x = 3 and y = 3, which gives us:\n\nF = 3, O = 3, G = 3\n\nTherefore, F + O + G = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. But we need to remember that we assumed that F, O, and G were all the same digit at the beginning, which gave us x = 91, which is impossible. Therefore, the only solution is:\n\nF = 3, O = 3, G = 3\n\nAnd F + O + G = 9, which we place in squiggly brackets to get the final answer: {9}.",

        "Response": "{D) 16 2/3}\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand that the amount of sugar in the solution remains constant even when water is evaporated. So, if we evaporate some water from the solution, the amount of sugar in the remaining solution will be the same, but the concentration of sugar will increase.\n\nLet's assume that we need to evaporate x liters of water from the original 50 liters of 3% sugar solution to get a 3% sugar solution. \n\nThe amount of sugar in the original solution is:\n\n3% of 50 liters = (3/100) x 50 = 1.5 liters\n\nAfter evaporating x liters of water, we will have (50-x) liters of the solution. The amount of sugar in this solution will still be 1.5 liters, but the concentration will be 3%. \n\nSo, we can write:\n\n1.5 liters = 3% of (50-x) liters\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1.5 = (3/100) x (50-x)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100, we get:\n\n150 = 3(50-x)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n150 = 150 - 3x\n\n3x = 150 - 150\n\n3x = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nThis means that we don't need to evaporate any water from the original solution to get a 3% sugar solution.

        "Response": "We can write $s/t$ as $8415/100$. Since $s$ and $t$ are integers, this means that $t$ must be a factor of $100$. We can then write $t$ as $2^a5^b$ for some non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. \n\nTo find the possible remainders when $s$ is divided by $t$, we can look at the remainders when $8415$ is divided by $2^a$ and $5^b$. \n\nFor option A, if the remainder when $s$ is divided by $t$ is $2$, then the remainder when $8415$ is divided by $2^a$ must also be $2$.

Therefore, option A is not possible. \n\nFor option B, if the remainder when $s$ is divided by $t$ is $4$, then the remainder when $8415$ is divided by $2^a$ must also be $4$. This is possible if $a \\geq 2$, since $8415$ is divisible by $4$. For example, if $a=2$, then $t=2^2\\cdot 5^b$ and $s$ could be $8415+4=8419$.

This is possible if $b \\geq 1$, since $8415$ is divisible by $5$. For example, if $b=1$, then $t=2^a\\cdot 5$ and $s$ could be $8415+20=8435$.

        "Response": "The number of officers on duty that night is half of the total number of officers on the police force, since the problem states that half of the officers on duty were female. Therefore, the total number of officers on the police force is:\n\n180 x 2 = 360\n\nIf 18 percent of the female officers were on duty that night, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.18x = number of female officers on duty\n\nwhere x is the total number of female officers on the police force. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.18:\n\nx = number of female officers on duty / 0.18\nx = 180 / 0.18\nx = 1000\n\nTherefore, there are 1000 female officers on the police force.

        "Response": "Answer: {D)865 m}\n\nExplanation:\nWe know that distance = speed \u00d7 time.\nLet the length of the tunnel be x meters.\nThe train covers a distance of 800 + x meters while crossing the tunnel.\nThe speed of the train is 78 km/hr, which is equal to (78 \u00d7 1000)/60 = 1300 m/min.\nThe time taken by the train to cross the tunnel is 1 minute.\nTherefore, we can write the equation as:\n800 + x = 1300 \u00d7 1\n800 + x = 1300\nx = 1300 - 800\nx = 500\nHence, the length of the tunnel is 500 meters. But the train has to cover this distance twice (while entering and exiting the tunnel). Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is 800 + 500 + 500 = 1800 meters.\nNow, we can find the speed of the train in meters per second as follows:\nSpeed = (78 \u00d7 1000)/3600 = 21.67 m/s\nWe know that speed = distance/time.\nTherefore, time taken by the train to cover a distance of 1800 meters is:\nTime = distance/speed = 1800/21.67 = 83.08 seconds.\nBut we know that the train takes only 1 minute (i.e., 60 seconds) to cross the tunnel.\nTherefore, the remaining time is the time taken by the train to cover the distance of 800 meters before entering the tunnel and after exiting the tunnel.\nRemaining time = 83.08 - 60 = 23.08 seconds.\nWe can use this time to find the speed of the train while it was outside the tunnel.\nDistance covered by the train while outside the tunnel = 800 meters.\nTime taken by the train while outside the tunnel = 23.08 seconds.\nSpeed = distance/time = 800/23.08 = 34.67 m/s.\nNow, we can use this speed to find the time taken by the train to cover the distance of 500 meters inside the tunnel.\nTime = distance/speed = 500/34.67 = 14.42 seconds.\nTherefore, the total time taken by the train to cross the tunnel is:\nTotal time = time taken inside the tunnel + time taken outside the tunnel\nTotal time = 1 + 14.42 = 15.42 seconds.\nWe can verify that the train covers a distance of 1800 meters in 15.42 seconds at a speed of 21.67 m/s.\nHence, the length of the tunnel is 865 meters.",

Then, by the distance formula, the sum of the distances from P to (8,0) and (0,12) is:\n\n$\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+y^2}+\\sqrt{x^2+(y-12)^2}$\n\nWe want to minimize this expression. One way to do this is to use the fact that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. In other words, the line segment connecting P to (8,0) and the line segment connecting P to (0,12) should intersect at a right angle.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\npair P, A, B;\n\nP = (5,7);\nA = (8,0);\nB = (0,12);\n\ndraw(P--A--B--cycle);\ndraw(rightanglemark(P,(P + reflect(B,A)*(P))/2,B,20));\n\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, N);\nlabel(\"$(8,0)$\", A, S);\nlabel(\"$(0,12)$\", B, W);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the intersection point be Q. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$PQ^2 + Q(8,0)^2 = P(8,0)^2$\n$PQ^2 + Q(0,12)^2 = P(0,12)^2$\n\nAdding these equations, we get:\n\n$2PQ^2 + 8x^2 + 144y^2 = 64 + 144$\n\n$2PQ^2 + 144x^2 + 12y^2 = 144$\n\n$PQ^2 = 72 - 72x^2 - 6y^2$\n\nWe want to minimize PQ, which is equivalent to minimizing PQ^2. Since PQ^2 is a quadratic function of x and y, it is minimized at the vertex of the paraboloid. The vertex occurs at:\n\n$x = 0$\n$y = 0$\n$PQ^2 = 72$\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the sum of the distances is:\n\n$\\sqrt{(8-x)^2+y^2}+\\sqrt{x^2+(12-y)^2} \\geq \\sqrt{64+144} = 4\\sqrt{20}$\n\nSo any point P that satisfies $PQ^2 = 72 - 72x^2 - 6y^2 = 80$ will minimize the sum of the distances. We can rewrite this equation as:\n\n$6y^2 + 72x^2 = -8$\n\nThis equation has no solutions in natural numbers, since the left-hand side is always nonnegative. Therefore, there are no points in set S that minimize the sum of the distances. The answer is $\\boxed{\\{0\\}}$.",

We can start by simplifying 5n:\n5n = 5(15a + 8)\n5n = 75a + 40\nTo find the remainder when 5n is divided by 6, we need to divide 75a + 40 by 6 and find the remainder. We can simplify this expression further by dividing both terms by 3:\n5n = 25(3a) + 40\n5n = 25(3a + 1) - 5\nNow, we can see that 25(3a + 1) is a multiple of 6, so it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 6.
