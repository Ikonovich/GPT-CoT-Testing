",
        "Response": "Let's call the distance Friend Q walks before they meet \"x\". This means that Friend P walks the remaining distance of 43-x. \nSince Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, we can set up the equation:\nSpeed of Friend Q = x/time = d/t\nSpeed of Friend P = 1.15(x)/(time) = (43-x)/(time)\nWe can set these two equations equal to each other since they will meet at the same time:\nx/time = (43-x)/(time*1.15)\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n1.15x = 43 - x\n2.15x = 43\nx = 20\nSo Friend Q walks 20 km before they meet, which means Friend P walks the remaining 23 km. Therefore, the answer is:\n{23}",

The new number of classes would be C-10, since there would be 10 fewer classes. The total number of students in the school would still be 120, so we have:\n(Q+1)*(C-10) = 120\nExpanding the left side and simplifying, we get:\nQC - 10Q + C - 10 = 120/ Q+1\nMultiplying both sides by Q+1, we get:\nQC - 10Q + C - 10 = 120\nSimplifying further, we get:\nQC - 10Q + C = 130\nFactoring out the common factor of Q, we get:\nQ(C-10) + C = 130\nSince we know that Q*C = total number of students, we can substitute and simplify:\nQ(total number of classes - 10) + total number of classes/Q = 130\nQ(C-10) + C/Q = 130\nMultiplying both sides by Q, we get:\nQ^2(C-10) + C = 130Q\nSince we are looking for the current ratio Q, we want to solve for Q.

        "Response": "We can rewrite the equation as\nbc + ac + ab = abc\nDividing both sides by abc, we get\n1/c + 1/a + 1/b = 1/abc\nSince a, b, and c are positive integers, we know that 1/c, 1/a, and 1/b are positive fractions. Therefore, 1/abc must also be a positive fraction, which means that abc must be greater than 0. This implies that a, b, and c are all greater than 0.\nLet's try to find a lower bound for c. Since a < b < c, we know that 1/c < 1/b < 1/a. Therefore,\n1/c + 1/b + 1/a < 1/a + 1/a + 1/a = 3/a\nBut we also know that 1/c + 1/b + 1/a = 1, so\n1 < 3/a\na < 3\nSince a is a positive integer, the only possible values for a are 1 and 2.\nIf a = 1, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/c = 1\nMultiplying both sides by bc, we get\nc + b = bc\nThis implies that b and c are both greater than 2. But then,\n1/b + 1/c < 1/2 + 1/3 < 1\nwhich contradicts the fact that 1/b + 1/c = 1. Therefore, a cannot be 1.\nIf a = 2, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/c = 1/2\nMultiplying both sides by 2bc, we get\n2c + 2b = bc\nDividing both sides by 2, we get\nc + b = (bc)/2\nSince b < c, we know that (bc)/2 > c, which implies that b + c > 2c. Therefore, c < 2(b+c). But we also know that\n1/c + 1/b + 1/a = 1\nSubstituting a = 2, we get\n1/c + 1/b = 1/2\nMultiplying both sides by 2bc, we get\n2c + 2b = bc\nTherefore, c = (2b)/(b-2). Since b > a = 2, we know that b > 2, which implies that c > 4. Therefore, b+c > 6, which implies that c < 2(b+c) < 2(b+c+a) = 20. Therefore, c can only be 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, or 18.\nIf c = 5, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/2 = 3/10\nMultiplying both sides by 10b, we get\n5b + 10 = 3b\nThis implies that b is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, c cannot be 5.\nIf c = 6, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/2 = 2/9\nMultiplying both sides by 9b, we get\n9 + 18b = 2b\nThis implies that b is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, c cannot be 6.\nIf c = 8, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/2 = 3/16\nMultiplying both sides by 16b, we get\n8 + 8b = 3b\nThis implies that b is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, c cannot be 8.\nIf c = 10, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/2 = 3/20\nMultiplying both sides by 20b, we get\n10 + 20b = 3b\nThis implies that b is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, c cannot be 10.\nIf c = 12, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/2 = 1/3\nMultiplying both sides by 3b, we get\n3 + 6b = 2b\nThis implies that b is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, c cannot be 12.\nIf c = 15, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/2 = 1/5\nMultiplying both sides by 5b, we get\n5 + 10b = 2b\nThis implies that b is negative, which is impossible. Therefore, c cannot be 15.\nIf c = 18, then the equation becomes\n1/b + 1/2 = 2/9\nMultiplying both sides by 9b, we get\n18 + 18b = 2b\nThis implies that b = -6, which is impossible. Therefore, c cannot be 18.\nTherefore, there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that a < b < c and 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1. The answer is {E).",

",
        "Response": "Let's assume that the vessel initially contains 8 liters of the liquid (3 parts water and 5 parts syrup). This means there are 3 liters of water and 5 liters of syrup in the vessel.\nLet's say we draw off x liters of the mixture and replace it with water. After this process, the amount of water in the vessel will be 3 - (3/8)x + x liters (we are subtracting the amount of water we drew off and adding the amount we replaced it with). Similarly, the amount of syrup in the vessel will be 5 - (5/8)x liters.\nWe want the mixture to be half water and half syrup. This means the amount of water should be equal to the amount of syrup. So we can set up the following equation:\n3 - (3/8)x + x = 5 - (5/8)x\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 8/3\nTherefore, we need to draw off and replace 8/3 liters of the mixture.

We can substitute this into the first equation to eliminate $d$:\n\\begin{align*}\nn &= (5q+27)q + 6 \\\\\nn &= 5q^2 + 27q + 6 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nNow we can use algebra to solve for $q$. We know that $n$ must be divisible by $d$, so we can use that fact to eliminate some possibilities:\n\\begin{align*}\nd &= 5q + 27 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 5q &< d < 6q \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 5q &< n < 6q+6 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe can test each answer choice to see which one satisfies this inequality.

Trying the other answer choices, we eventually find that $\\boxed{\\{92\\}}$ works:\n\\begin{align*}\n5q &< 40 < 6q \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 6.67 &< q < 8 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 92 &< n < 98 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\{92\\}}$.",

This means that the amount of raw material B in the final mixture is also (50/100) times the total amount of the mixture. \nSo, we can set up the following equation: \n(77/12)x = (50/100) * (864 + w) \nwhere w is the amount of water added to product M. \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \nx = (50/100) * (864 + w) * (12/77) \nWe know that x represents the amount of product M produced in the ratio of 5:4 of X and Y. So, we can set up another equation: \nx = 5y = 4z \nwhere y is the amount of chemical X and z is the amount of chemical Y. \nSubstituting the values of y and z in terms of x, we get: \ny = (1/4) * 5x = (5/4)x \nz = (1/2) * 4x = 2x \nSo, the total amount of the final mixture is: \nx + y + z = x + (5/4)x + 2x = (13/4)x \nWe know that the total amount of the final mixture is 864 + w. So, we can set up another equation: \n(13/4)x = 864 + w \nSubstituting the value of x from the first equation into this equation, we get: \n(13/4) * (50/100) * (864 + w) * (12/77) = 864 + w \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \nw = {392} \nTherefore, the amount of water added to product M is 392 units. \nThe answer is (C).",

We will consider each possibility separately.\nIf the first two runners tie for first place, then we have 2 choices for the gold medalist (either of the tied runners), 1 choice for the silver medalist (the other tied runner), and 2 choices for the bronze medalist (either of the other two runners).

Thus, there are $4\\cdot1\\cdot1=4$ possible victory circles in this case.\nSince there are 2 ways to choose which two runners tie, the total number of victory circles in this case is $2\\cdot(2+4)=12$.\nAdding up the number of victory circles in each case, we get $24+9+12=\\boxed{45}$.",

Therefore, in 10 days, 3 men can do a total of 40 units of work (4 units per day x 10 days x 3 men). Similarly, in 10 days, 4 women can do a total of 40 units of work (3 men = 4 women, so the total work done is the same). \nNow, we need to find out how long it will take 5 men and 6 women to do the same amount of work. Let's call the number of days it will take them \"d\". \nIn one day, 5 men can do 5/3 units of work (since 3 men = 4 women, 5 men = 6.67 women). Similarly, in one day, 6 women can do 6/4 = 1.5 units of work. \nTherefore, in \"d\" days, 5 men and 6 women can do a total of:\n(5/3 units per day x d days x 5 men) + (1.5 units per day x d days x 6 women) = 12 units of work\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n25d/3 + 9d = 36\n34d/3 = 36\nd = 9/17\nTherefore, it will take 5 men and 6 women {9/17} days to reap the field. \nThe answer is option A) {19/60}.",

There are $12$ ways to choose the president in this case. \nTherefore, the total number of ways for Harry to be either the secretary or the treasurer is $13\\cdot 12 + 13\\cdot 12 - 12 = 300$. \nThe probability of this happening is $\\dfrac{300}{14\\cdot 13\\cdot 12} = \\boxed{\\{ \\frac{5}{7} \\}}$.",

There are 15 factors of 2 and 8 factors of 3. To remove all factors of 2 and 3 that are not in $18^k$, we need to remove all factors of 2 and 3 that appear fewer than $2k$ and $k$ times, respectively.

Then B's rent would be $1.5x. \nA's cows were on the pasture for 7 months, so the total rent paid by A is 7*$80*x = $560x. \nThe total rent for both A and B for 10 months is 10*($80+$B's cows rent) = $800 + $10B's cows rent. \nThus, we have the equation: \n$800 + $10(1.5x) = $560x + $3x(3) \nSimplifying and solving for x, we get x = 7. \nTherefore, B's cows rent is $1.5(7) = $10.50 per cow per month. \nFor the remaining 3 months, B can put in $560x/(3*$10.50) = 16.95, which rounds up to 17 cows. \nTherefore, the answer is {17}.",

        "Response": "Let's start by using the formula for combinations: \nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\nWe know that there are 5 chairs in the warehouse, and we need to choose 4 of them. So the number of chair combinations is:\n5C4 = 5! / 4!(5-4)! = 5\nFor each of these chair combinations, we need to choose 4 tables. Let's call the number of tables in the warehouse \"t\". Then the number of table combinations for each chair combination is:\ntC4 = t! / 4!(t-4)!\nWe know that the total number of combinations is 75. So we can set up an equation:\n5 * tC4 = 75\nSimplifying:\nt! / 4!(t-4)! = 15\nt(t-1)(t-2)(t-3) / 4! = 15\nt(t-1)(t-2)(t-3) = 15 * 4!\nt(t-1)(t-2)(t-3) = 360\nAt this point, we could try different values of t until we find one that works. But we can also notice that 360 is a multiple of 5, which means that t(t-1)(t-2)(t-3) must be a multiple of 5 as well. The only way this can happen is if at least one of the factors is a multiple of 5. The only factor of t that is a multiple of 5 is t-5 (since there are only 5 chairs). So let's try t = 10:\n10 * 9 * 8 * 7 = 5040\nNope, that's too big. Let's try t = 8:\n8 * 7 * 6 * 5 = 1680\nThat works! So the answer is {8}.",

        "Response": "Let the speed of the train be x km/hr.\nWhen the train overtakes the first person, it covers a distance equal to the sum of their lengths.\nTherefore, distance = (4.5/3600) * 8.4 + L1, where L1 is the length of the first person.\nSimilarly, when the train overtakes the second person, distance = (5.4/3600) * 8.5 + L2, where L2 is the length of the second person.\nSince the train overtakes the second person in a shorter time, its speed must be higher than the speed of the second person.\nTherefore, x > 5.4.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n(4.5/3600) * 8.4 - (5.4/3600) * 8.5 + L1 - L2 = 0\nSimplifying, we get:\nL1 - L2 = 0.025\nNow, when both persons are walking in the same direction as the train, the relative speed of the train with respect to the first person is (x - 4.5) km/hr.\nSimilarly, the relative speed of the train with respect to the second person is (x - 5.4) km/hr.\nSince the train overtakes both persons, its relative speed with respect to each person must be greater than their respective speeds.\nTherefore, x - 4.5 > 0 and x - 5.4 > 0.\nSolving for x, we get:\nx > 4.5 and x > 5.4\nTherefore, x > 5.4.\nNow, when both persons are walking in the same direction as the train, the train overtakes the slower person in a time t1 given by:\nt1 = L1 / (x - 4.5)\nSimilarly, the train overtakes the faster person in a time t2 given by:\nt2 = L2 / (x - 5.4)\nSince the train overtakes the second person in a shorter time, we have:\nt2 < t1\nSubstituting the values of L1 and L2, we get:\n0.025 / (x - 4.5) > 0.025 / (x - 5.4)\nSimplifying, we get:\nx > 62\nTherefore, the speed of the train is {62}.",

We also know that the surface area of a cone is $\\pi r \\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the slant height. Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be the surface areas of the two cones, respectively.

        "Response": "Let's start by using the formula: speed = distance/time.\nFrom home to grocery, Angelina walked 150 meters at a certain speed. Let's call this speed \"x\". Therefore, the time it took her to walk from home to grocery is:\ntime = distance/speed = 150/x\nFrom grocery to gym, Angelina walked 200 meters at double the speed. Therefore, her speed from grocery to gym is 2x. Let's call the time it took her to walk from grocery to gym \"t\". We know that she spent 10 seconds less on her way from grocery to gym than on her way from home to grocery. In other words:\nt = (150/x) - 10\nNow we can use the formula again to find Angelina's speed from grocery to gym:\nspeed = distance/time = 200/t = 200/[(150/x) - 10]\nTo simplify this expression, we can first find a common denominator:\nspeed = 200/[150/x - 10] * [x/x] = 200x/[150 - 10x]\nNow we can solve for x by using the fact that Angelina's speed from home to grocery is the same as her speed from grocery to gym:\nx = 2(2x) = 4x\n150/x = 200/[150 - 10x]\n150(150 - 10x) = 200x\n22500 - 1500x = 200x\n1700x = 22500\nx = 13.235\nTherefore, Angelina's speed from grocery to gym is:\nspeed = 200/[150/x - 10] = 200/[150/13.235 - 10] = 3 {B}",

At the beginning of the 5th hour, the remaining job is 3/4.\nDuring the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th hours, the remaining workers have a combined productivity ratio of 5 + 9 = 14.

",
        "Response": "Let the length, width, and height of the foil covered prism be $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively. Then we have $lw+lh+wh=2(2l+2h+wh)$, since the surface area of the foil covered prism is equal to the surface area of the $128$ cubes plus the surface area of the foil covered prism. Simplifying this equation gives $lw-4l-4h+wh-8=0$. We also know that the volume of the foil covered prism is equal to the volume of the $128$ cubes, which is $128$. Thus, we have $lwh=128$. We can solve for $h$ in terms of $l$ and $w$ using this equation: $h=\\frac{128}{lw}$. Substituting this into the first equation gives $lw-4l-\\frac{512}{lw}+w\\cdot\\frac{128}{lw}-8=0$. Multiplying both sides by $lw$ and simplifying gives $w^2-4w-512+128l-8l^2=0$. We are given that the width of the figure created by the $128$ cubes is twice the length and twice the height, so $w=4h$ and $l=2h$. Substituting these into the equation above and simplifying gives $h^2-4h+32=0$. Solving for $h$ using the quadratic formula gives $h=2\\pm2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $h$ must be an integer, we have $h=2+2\\sqrt{2}$. Substituting this into $w=4h$ gives $w=8+8\\sqrt{2}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\{8+8\\sqrt{2}\\}}$.",

        "Response": "Let's first find out how long it takes for them to pass each other. We can use the formula:\ndistance = rate x time\nSince they are moving towards each other, we can add their rates to get their combined rate:\ncombined rate = 46 mph + 54 mph = 100 mph\nWe know that they are 190 miles apart at 2:00 pm, so we can plug in the values:\n190 miles = 100 mph x time\ntime = 1.9 hours\nSo they pass each other 1.9 hours after 2:00 pm, which is at 3:54 pm.\nNow we need to find out when they are 35 miles apart and moving away from each other. Since they are moving away from each other, we can subtract their rates to get their relative rate:\nrelative rate = 54 mph - 46 mph = 8 mph\nWe want to know when they are 35 miles apart, so we can use the formula again:\ndistance = rate x time\n35 miles = 8 mph x time\ntime = 4.375 hours\nSo they are 35 miles apart and moving away from each other 4.375 hours after they pass each other, which is at 8:19 pm.\nHowever, the question asks for the clock time, not the amount of time elapsed. We need to add the 1.9 hours it took for them to pass each other to get the total time elapsed:\n8:19 pm + 1.9 hours = 10:09 pm\nBut the question asks for the answer in 12-hour clock time format, so we need to convert 10:09 pm to that format. Since it's after 12:00 pm, we subtract 12 from the hour:\n10:09 pm - 12:00 pm = 10:09 - 12:00 = -1:51\nSo the final answer is {-1:51}, which means 1 hour and 51 minutes before 12:00 pm, or 10:09 am.

We want to find $P(A\\cup B)$, the probability that a number less than or equal to 20 is drawn.\nWe can use the formula $P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B)$, where $P(A\\cap B)$ is the probability that both events occur. In this case, $A\\cap B$ is the event that a number between 12 and 20, inclusive, is drawn and the number is 12 or larger.

        "Response": "{500}\nLet the true weight be 100 units and the cost price be $100. The dealer sells it at the cost price but with a false weight, say x units. So, the selling price becomes (100/x)*100. \nNow, the dealer gains 25% profit. So, \n(100/x)*100 = 125 \nx = 80 \nSo, the false weight is 80 units for a true weight of 100 units. \nTo find the false weightage, we use the formula: \nFalse weightage = (False weight / True weight) * 100 \nFalse weightage = (80/100) * 100 = 80% \nBut we need to find the percentage of false weightage in terms of the true weightage. \nSo, \nFalse weightage in terms of true weightage = (False weightage / (False weightage + 100)) * 100 \nFalse weightage in terms of true weightage = (80 / (80 + 100)) * 100 = 44.44% \nNow, we need to find the percentage increase in false weightage from the true weightage. \nPercentage increase = ((False weightage - True weightage) / True weightage) * 100 \nPercentage increase = ((44.44 - 40) / 40) * 100 = 11.11% \nFinally, we need to find the false weightage as a percentage of the true weightage plus the false weightage. \nFalse weightage as a percentage of the total weightage = (False weightage / (True weightage + False weightage)) * 100 \nFalse weightage as a percentage of the total weightage = (80 / (100 + 80)) * 100 = 44.44% \nTherefore, the false weightage is 500% of the true weightage. \nHence, the answer is {500}.",

        "Response": "Let's first find out how much work Vinoth can do in one day:\nVinoth's one day work = 1/20\nSimilarly, Prakash's one day work = 1/25\nWhen they work together for 3 days, the total work done = (Vinoth's 3 days work) + (Prakash's 3 days work)\n= (3/20) + (3/25)\n= (15 + 12)/500\n= 27/500\nSo, the remaining work = 1 - 27/500\n= 473/500\nNow, we need to find out how many days Prakash will take to complete this remaining work alone.\nLet's assume Prakash takes x days to complete the remaining work alone.\nSo, Prakash's x days work = 473/500\nTherefore, Prakash's one day work = (473/500)/x\n= 473/500x\nWe know Prakash's one day work = 1/25\nSo, we can equate these two and find x:\n473/500x = 1/25\nx = (500/473) x 25\nx = 26.38\nTherefore, Prakash will take approximately 26.38 days to complete the remaining work alone.\nRounding off to two decimal places, we get:\nx = 26.38 \u2248 {26.25}\nHence, the answer is {26.25}.",

Let $x$ be the median of the 5 integers. Then $r$ must be either $x$ or $x+1$, since $r$ is the middle number. We want to maximize $x$, so we want to maximize $r$. If $r = x+1$, then $k+m+s = 30 - (r+t) = 30 - 21 = 9$. Since $s > r$, we have $s \\geq r+1$, so $k+m \\leq 7$. But $k < m$, so the maximum possible value of $k+m$ is $5+6=11$.

        "Query": "In a certain mathematical activity, we have five cards with five different prime numbers on them. We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide only the answer.. ",
        "Response": "We can start by listing out all the possible combinations of the five prime numbers in the envelopes. There are $3^5 = 243$ ways to distribute the cards among the envelopes. For each distribution, we can calculate the product of the numbers in each envelope and sort them in increasing order to get a set. \nHowever, we notice that some of these sets will be the same. For example, if we distribute the cards as $(2,3)$, $(5)$, and $(7,11)$, we get the same set as if we distribute the cards as $(2,11)$, $(3,5)$, and $(7)$. This is because the product of the numbers in each envelope is the same in both cases: $2\\cdot3=6$ for the first envelope, $5$ for the second envelope, and $7\\cdot11=77$ for the third envelope. \nTo count the number of distinct sets, we need to figure out how many times each set appears. Let's start by counting the number of ways to distribute the cards such that the product of the numbers in each envelope is a certain value $p$. We can think of this as finding the number of solutions to the equation $abc=p$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the products of the numbers in each envelope. \nSince $p$ is the product of three prime numbers, there are only a few possibilities for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Without loss of generality, let's assume that $a$ is the smallest product. Then $a$ must be either 1 (if one of the envelopes is empty) or one of the prime numbers. If $a=1$, then $bc=p$, and there are $2^2=4$ ways to distribute the remaining cards among the two envelopes. If $a$ is a prime number, then we can write $p=ad$, where $d$ is the product of the other two primes. Then $b$ and $c$ must be divisors of $d$, and there are $(k+1)^2$ ways to distribute the remaining cards among the two envelopes, where $k$ is the number of prime factors of $d$. \nPutting it all together, we get the following counts for each possible value of $p$:\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}\n$p$ & Number of ways to distribute cards & Number of sets \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 4 & 4 \\\\\n5 & 4 & 4 \\\\\n7 & 4 & 4 \\\\\n11 & 4 & 4 \\\\\n13 & 9 & 9 \\\\\n17 & 9 & 9 \\\\\n19 & 9 & 9 \\\\\n23 & 9 & 9 \\\\\n29 & 9 & 9 \\\\\n31 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n37 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n41 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n43 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n47 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n53 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n59 & 16 & 16 \\\\\n61 & 25 & 25 \\\\\n67 & 25 & 25 \\\\\n71 & 25 & 25 \\\\\n73 & 25 & 25 \\\\\n79 & 25 & 25 \\\\\n83 & 25 & 25 \\\\\n89 & 25 & 25 \\\\\n97 & 25 & 25 \\\\\n101 & 36 & 36 \\\\\n103 & 36 & 36 \\\\\n107 & 36 & 36 \\\\\n109 & 36 & 36 \\\\\n113 & 36 & 36 \\\\\n127 & 49 & 49 \\\\\n131 & 49 & 49 \\\\\n137 & 49 & 49 \\\\\n139 & 49 & 49 \\\\\n149 & 64 & 64 \\\\\n151 & 64 & 64 \\\\\n157 & 64 & 64 \\\\\n163 & 64 & 64 \\\\\n167 & 64 & 64 \\\\\n173 & 64 & 64 \\\\\n179 & 64 & 64 \\\\\n181 & 81 & 81 \\\\\n191 & 81 & 81 \\\\\n193 & 81 & 81 \\\\\n197 & 81 & 81 \\\\\n199 & 81 & 81 \\\\\n211 & 81 & 81 \\\\\n223 & 81 & 81 \\\\\n227 & 81 & 81 \\\\\n229 & 100 & 100 \\\\\n233 & 100 & 100 \\\\\n239 & 100 & 100 \\\\\n241 & 100 & 100 \\\\\n251 & 121 & 121 \\\\\n257 & 121 & 121 \\\\\n263 & 121 & 121 \\\\\n269 & 121 & 121 \\\\\n271 & 144 & 144 \\\\\n277 & 144 & 144 \\\\\n281 & 144 & 144 \\\\\n283 & 144 & 144 \\\\\n293 & 169 & 169 \\\\\n307 & 169 & 169 \\\\\n311 & 169 & 169 \\\\\n313 & 196 & 196 \\\\\n317 & 196 & 196 \\\\\n331 & 196 & 196 \\\\\n337 & 196 & 196 \\\\\n347 & 225 & 225 \\\\\n349 & 225 & 225 \\\\\n353 & 225 & 225 \\\\\n359 & 225 & 225 \\\\\n367 & 256 & 256 \\\\\n373 & 256 & 256 \\\\\n379 & 256 & 256 \\\\\n383 & 256 & 256 \\\\\n389 & 289 & 289 \\\\\n397 & 289 & 289 \\\\\n401 & 289 & 289 \\\\\n409 & 289 & 289 \\\\\n419 & 324 & 324 \\\\\n421 & 324 & 324 \\\\\n431 & 324 & 324 \\\\\n433 & 324 & 324 \\\\\n439 & 361 & 361 \\\\\n443 & 361 & 361 \\\\\n449 & 361 & 361 \\\\\n457 & 361 & 361 \\\\\n461 & 400 & 400 \\\\\n463 & 400 & 400 \\\\\n467 & 400 & 400 \\\\\n479 & 400 & 400 \\\\\n487 & 441 & 441 \\\\\n491 & 441 & 441 \\\\\n499 & 441 & 441 \\\\\n503 & 441 & 441 \\\\\n509 & 484 & 484 \\\\\n521 & 484 & 484 \\\\\n523 & 484 & 484 \\\\\n541 & 529 & 529 \\\\\n547 & 529 & 529 \\\\\n557 & 576 & 576 \\\\\n563 & 576 & 576 \\\\\n569 & 576 & 576 \\\\\n571 & 625 & 625 \\\\\n577 & 625 & 625 \\\\\n587 & 625 & 625 \\\\\n593 & 676 & 676 \\\\\n599 & 676 & 676 \\\\\n601 & 676 & 676 \\\\\n607 & 729 & 729 \\\\\n613 & 729 & 729 \\\\\n617 & 729 & 729 \\\\\n619 & 784 & 784 \\\\\n631 & 784 & 784 \\\\\n641 & 841 & 841 \\\\\n643 & 841 & 841 \\\\\n647 & 841 & 841 \\\\\n653 & 900 & 900 \\\\\n659 & 900 & 900 \\\\\n661 & 900 & 900 \\\\\n673 & 961 & 961 \\\\\n677 & 961 & 961 \\\\\n683 & 1024 & 1024 \\\\\n691 & 1024 & 1024 \\\\\n701 & 1089 & 1089 \\\\\n709 & 1089 & 1089 \\\\\n719 & 1156 & 1156 \\\\\n727 & 1156 & 1156 \\\\\n733 & 1225 & 1225 \\\\\n739 & 1225 & 1225 \\\\\n743 & 1296 & 1296 \\\\\n751 & 1296 & 1296 \\\\\n757 & 1369 & 1369 \\\\\n761 & 1369 & 1369 \\\\\n769 & 1444 & 1444 \\\\\n773 & 1444 & 1444 \\\\\n787 & 1521 & 1521 \\\\\n797 & 1521 & 1521 \\\\\n809 & 1600 & 1600 \\\\\n811 & 1600 & 1600 \\\\\n821 & 1681 & 1681 \\\\\n823 & 1681 & 1681 \\\\\n827 & 1764 & 1764 \\\\\n829 & 1764 & 1764 \\\\\n839 & 1849 & 1849 \\\\\n853 & 1936 & 1936 \\\\\n857 & 1936 & 1936 \\\\\n859 & 2025 & 2025 \\\\\n863 & 2025 & 2025 \\\\\n877 & 2116 & 2116 \\\\\n881 & 2116 & 2116 \\\\\n883 & 2209 & 2209 \\\\\n887 & 2209 & 2209 \\\\\n907 & 2304 & 2304 \\\\\n911 & 2304 & 2304 \\\\\n919 & 2401 & 2401 \\\\\n929 & 2500 & 2500 \\\\\n937 & 2601 & 2601 \\\\\n941 & 2601 & 2601 \\\\\n947 & 2704 & 2704 \\\\\n953 & 2809 & 2809 \\\\\n967 & 2916 & 2916 \\\\\n971 & 2916 & 2916 \\\\\n977 & 3025 & 3025 \\\\\n983 & 3136 & 3136 \\\\\n991 & 3249 & 3249 \\\\\n997 & 3364 & 3364\n\\end{tabular}\nTo get the total number of distinct sets, we add up the number of sets for each value of $p$:\n$$1+4\\cdot5+9\\cdot10+16",

        "Response": "Let A be the amount of money Al has in his account and E be the amount of money Eliot has in his account. We know that A > E and A - E = (A + E)/10.\nAfter the increase, Al will have 1.1A and Eliot will have 1.2E. We can set up the equation:\n1.1A - 1.2E = 22\nMultiplying the first equation by 10, we get:\n10A - 10E = A + E\n9A = 11E\nSubstituting 11E/9 for A in the second equation, we get:\n1.1(11E/9) - 1.2E = 22\nSimplifying, we get:\nE = 152.3\nTherefore, Eliot has $152.3 in his account right now.

",
        "Response": "Let's call the runner's constant speed in the first half of the run \"x\". Then, the time it took her to run the first half (20 miles) would be:\ntime = distance \u00f7 speed\ntime = 20 miles \u00f7 x\nFor the second half of the run, her speed is half of x, so we can call it \"0.5x\". The distance she needs to cover in the second half is also 20 miles. The time it took her to run the second half would be:\ntime = distance \u00f7 speed\ntime = 20 miles \u00f7 0.5x\ntime = 40 miles \u00f7 x - 8\nWe know that the second half took 8 hours longer than the first half, so we can set up an equation:\n40 miles \u00f7 x - 8 = 20 miles \u00f7 0.5x\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n80 = 40 \u00f7 0.5 - 8x\n80 = 80 - 8x\n8x = 0\nx = 0\nWait a minute, x is 0? That doesn't make sense. It means the runner didn't move at all in the first half of the run. What went wrong?\nLet's think about the problem again. If the runner runs at a constant speed, then the time it takes her to run a certain distance is inversely proportional to her speed. In other words, if she runs twice as fast, it will take her half the time to cover the same distance. So, if she runs at x speed in the first half and 0.5x speed in the second half, it should take her twice as long to cover the same distance in the second half.\nLet's try setting up the equation again, using this relationship:\n40 miles \u00f7 x - 8 = 2(20 miles \u00f7 x)\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n40 miles \u00f7 x - 40 miles \u00f7 x = 8\n0 = 8\nUh oh, we got another problem. This equation has no solution. What's going on?\nLet's think about the problem again. We know that the runner covered the same distance in the first half and the second half. We also know that she ran at a constant speed in each half.
