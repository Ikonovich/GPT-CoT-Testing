We perform these first, from left to right: \n\n2 + 4 * 5 * 6 + 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 + 20 * 6 + 2 + 2 - 2 \n\nNext, we perform addition and subtraction, again from left to right: \n\n2 + 20 * 6 + 2 + 2 - 2 = 2 + 120 + 2 + 2 - 2 = 124 \n\nTherefore, the answer is 124.",

Multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction, and within multiplication and division, we should also follow the order of operations. \n\nSo, first we need to multiply 9 by 9, which gives us 81. Then we multiply 8 by 81, which gives us 648. Next, we add 8 to 648, which gives us 656. Then we subtract 3 from 656, which gives us 653. Finally, we add 7 and 7 to get 14. \n\nPutting it all together: \n\n8 + 8 * 9 * 9 - 3 + 7 + 7 = 8 + 648 - 3 + 14 = 656 + 14 = 670. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 670.",
