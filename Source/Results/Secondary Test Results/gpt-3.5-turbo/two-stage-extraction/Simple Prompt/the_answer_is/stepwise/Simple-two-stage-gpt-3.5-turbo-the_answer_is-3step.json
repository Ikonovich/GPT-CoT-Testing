There is only one multiplication operation, which is 9 * 2, and the result is 18. \n\nThen, you move on to addition and subtraction. There are two addition operations: 6 + 18 and 18 + 7. \n\n6 + 18 = 24 \n\n24 + 7 = 31 \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 31.",

Moving from left to right, we perform any multiplication or division. There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression. \n\n4. Finally, we perform any addition or subtraction. \n\nStarting with 7, we add 9 to get 16. Then we subtract 9 to get 7. Finally, we add 4 to get 11. \n\nSo, 7 - 9 - 9 + 4 = 11.",
