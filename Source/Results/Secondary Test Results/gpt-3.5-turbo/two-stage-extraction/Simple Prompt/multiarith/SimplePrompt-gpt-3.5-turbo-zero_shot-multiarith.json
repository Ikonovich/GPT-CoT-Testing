        "Response": "Lana had a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing. \n\nTo find out, you can start by multiplying the number of scarves and mittens in each box: \n\n2 scarves x 6 mittens = 12 pieces of winter clothing per box \n\nThen, you can multiply that by the number of boxes: \n\n12 pieces per box x 4 boxes = 48 pieces of winter clothing \n\nHowever, since each box contains both scarves and mittens, you need to divide that total by 2 to get the actual number of unique pieces: \n\n48 pieces / 2 = 24 unique pieces of winter clothing \n\nSo Lana had a total of 24 scarves and mittens combined. But since each scarf and mitten is a separate piece, you need to multiply that by 2 to get the total number of pieces: \n\n24 unique pieces x 2 = 48 pieces of winter clothing \n\nHowever, since each box contains both scarves and mittens, you need to divide that total by 2 to get the actual number of unique pieces: \n\n48 pieces / 2 = 24 unique pieces of winter clothing \n\nSo Lana had a total of 24 scarves and mittens combined.

        "Response": "Oliver used a total of 30 tickets. \n\nTo see why, you can use multiplication: \n\n- Oliver rode the ferris wheel 7 times, so he used 7 x 3 = 21 tickets. \n- Oliver rode the bumper cars 3 times, so he used 3 x 3 = 9 tickets. \n\nAdding those two amounts together, you get: \n\n21 + 9 = 30 \n\nTherefore, Oliver used 30 tickets in total.",

        "Response": "Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. Let's call the number of players on Paige's team \"x\". \n\nWe know that Paige scored 11 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each. So the total number of points scored can be represented as: \n\n11 + 6(x-1) \n\nWe subtract 1 from x because Paige is already included in the total. \n\nWe also know that the total number of points scored was 41. So we can set up an equation: \n\n11 + 6(x-1) = 41 \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\n11 + 6x - 6 = 41 \n\n6x + 5 = 41 \n\n6x = 36 \n\nx = 6 \n\nSo there were 6 players on Paige's team.",

Subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies to find how many were left: 81 - 41 = 40.\n2. Divide the remaining number of puppies by the maximum number of puppies per cage to find how many full cages can be filled: 40 \u00f7 8 = 5.\n3.

        "Query": " Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total. If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? ",
        "Response": "Let's start by subtracting Bianca's score from the total: \n\n75 - 45 = 30 \n\nWe know that everyone else on the team scored 6 points each. Let's use \"x\" to represent the number of players on the team (not including Bianca): \n\n6x = 30 \n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6: \n\nx = 5 \n\nSo there were 5 players on Bianca's team (not including Bianca herself).",
