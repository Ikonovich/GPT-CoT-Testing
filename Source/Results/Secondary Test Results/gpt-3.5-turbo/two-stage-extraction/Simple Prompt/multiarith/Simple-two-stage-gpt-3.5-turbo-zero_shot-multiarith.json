        "Response": "You would earn 30 points. \n\nExplanation: \n\nIf each enemy defeated gives you 5 points, and there are 8 enemies total, then the total number of points available in the level is: \n\n8 enemies x 5 points per enemy = 40 points \n\nIf you destroy all but 6 of the enemies, then you have defeated: \n\n8 enemies - 6 enemies = 2 enemies \n\nEach of those 2 enemies is worth 5 points, so your total points earned would be: \n\n2 enemies x 5 points per enemy = 10 points \n\nAdding that to the points earned from defeating all 8 enemies: \n\n10 points + 30 points = 40 points \n\nSo you would earn a total of 30 points for defeating 6 out of 8 enemies.",
