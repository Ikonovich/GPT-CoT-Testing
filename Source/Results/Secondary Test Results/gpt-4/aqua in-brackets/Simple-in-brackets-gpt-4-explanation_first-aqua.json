        "Response": "Let x be the distance walked by Friend Q. Then, the distance walked by Friend P is 1.15x. Since they started at opposite ends of the trail, the sum of the distances they walked is equal to the length of the trail, which is 43 km. So, we have the equation:\n\nx + 1.15x = 43\n\nCombining the terms on the left side, we get:\n\n2.15x = 43\n\nNow, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2.15:\n\nx = 43 / 2.15 \u2248 20\n\nNow that we have the distance walked by Friend Q, we can find the distance walked by Friend P by multiplying x by 1.15:\n\n1.15x \u2248 1.15 * 20 \u2248 23\n\nSo, Friend P will have walked approximately 23 kilometers when they pass each other.\n\nThe final answer is E)23.",

Then, after a 10% gain, the amount of fluid is 1.1x. \n\nWe are given that 1.1x = 200gm. So, x = 200gm / 1.1 = 181.82gm (approximately).\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage difference between the actual amount of fluid (200gm) and the initial amount of fluid (181.82gm).\n\nPercentage difference = (Actual amount - Initial amount) / Initial amount * 100\n\nPercentage difference = (200gm - 181.82gm) / 181.82gm * 100 = 18.18gm / 181.82gm * 100 = 10%\n\nSince the problem states that there is a 10% gain on the initial fluid, the actual percentage difference is 10% + 10% = 20%.\n\nSo, the actual percentage difference is 20%.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the difference between the actual percentage difference (20%) and the percentage difference if the bottle contained 1kg of fluid (1000gm).\n\nPercentage difference for 1kg of fluid = (1000gm - 181.82gm) / 181.82gm * 100 = 818.18gm / 181.82gm * 100 = 450%\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the actual percentage difference (20%) and the percentage difference for 1kg of fluid (450%).\n\nDifference = 450% - 20% = 430%\n\nSo, the actual percentage difference is 430%.\n\nThe final answer is {430%}.",

        "Response": "There are a total of 5! ways to arrange the 3 persons in the 5 chairs. However, we can think of the couple as a single entity, so there are 4! ways to arrange the couple and the single person in the 4 \"spots\" (3 chairs and 1 couple). Then, there are 2! ways to arrange the couple within their \"spot.\" So, there are 4! * 2! ways to arrange the 3 persons with the couple sitting together.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of ways to arrange the 3 persons with the couple not sitting together. We can find this by subtracting the number of ways with the couple sitting together from the total number of ways. So, there are 5! - 4! * 2! ways to arrange the 3 persons with the couple not sitting together.\n\nThe probability that the couple does not sit together is the number of ways they don't sit together divided by the total number of ways to arrange the 3 persons. So, the probability is (5! - 4! * 2!) / 5!.\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can factor out a 4! from the numerator:\n\n(5! - 4! * 2!) / 5! = 4! * (5 - 2) / 5! = 4! * 3 / 5!\n\nNow, we can cancel out the 4! from the numerator and denominator:\n\n4! * 3 / 5! = 3 / 5\n\nSo, the probability that the couple does not sit together is 3/5.\n\nThe final answer is {3/5}.",

We will first find the probability that none of the 8 customers bought both a coffee and a bagel, and then subtract that probability from 1.\n\nLet A be the event that a customer buys a bagel, and B be the event that a customer buys a coffee. We are given that P(A) = 3/5 and P(B) = 5/7. We want to find P(A \u2229 B), the probability that a customer buys both a bagel and a coffee.\n\nWe can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). We know that P(A \u222a B) is the probability that a customer buys either a bagel or a coffee or both. Since some customers bought both, we can assume that all customers bought either a bagel or a coffee or both. Therefore, P(A \u222a B) = 1.\n\nNow we can solve for P(A \u2229 B): 1 = (3/5) + (5/7) - P(A \u2229 B)\nP(A \u2229 B) = (3/5) + (5/7) - 1 = 16/35\n\nNow we want to find the probability that none of the 8 customers bought both a coffee and a bagel.

        "Response": "Let the amount of work be W. \n\nAccording to the given information, 10 women can complete the work in 9 days. So, the combined rate of 10 women is W/9.\n\nSimilarly, 10 children can complete the work in 12 days. So, the combined rate of 10 children is W/12.\n\nNow, we need to find the combined rate of 6 women and 7 children. \n\nThe rate of 1 woman is (W/9) / 10 = W/90, and the rate of 1 child is (W/12) / 10 = W/120.\n\nThe combined rate of 6 women is 6 * (W/90) = 6W/90 = W/15.\n\nThe combined rate of 7 children is 7 * (W/120) = 7W/120.\n\nNow, the combined rate of 6 women and 7 children is (W/15) + (7W/120).\n\nTo find the number of days they will take to complete the work, we need to divide the total work (W) by their combined rate:\n\nDays = W / [(W/15) + (7W/120)]\n\nTo solve this, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 15 and 120 is 120. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nDays = W / [(8W/120) + (7W/120)]\n\nDays = W / [(8W + 7W) / 120]\n\nDays = W / (15W / 120)\n\nDays = (W * 120) / (15W)\n\nDays = 120 / 15\n\nDays = 8\n\nSo, 6 women and 7 children will take 8 days to complete the work.\n\nThe final answer is {D}.",

        "Response": "Let the consumption of diesel per hour be C litres and the speed of the bus be S kmph. According to the problem, C is directly proportional to the square of S, so we can write:\n\nC = k * S^2, where k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nWhen the bus is travelling at 60 kmph, its consumption is 1 litre per hour. We can use this information to find the value of k:\n\n1 = k * (60)^2\nk = 1 / 3600\n\nNow we have the equation for the consumption of diesel per hour in terms of the speed of the bus:\n\nC = (1/3600) * S^2\n\nThe total cost of diesel for a trip is the product of the consumption per hour, the cost per litre, and the number of hours. The other expenses per hour are given as $60. Let T be the total expenditure for the trip, then:\n\nT = (C * 60 + 60) * (600 / S)\n\nWe want to minimize the total expenditure T. To do this, we can take the derivative of T with respect to S and set it equal to zero:\n\ndT/dS = 0\n\nUsing the chain rule, we get:\n\ndT/dS = (d(C * 60 + 60) / dS) * (600 / S) + (C * 60 + 60) * (d(600 / S) / dS)\n\nSubstituting the expression for C, we get:\n\ndT/dS = ((1/3600) * 2 * S * 60) * (600 / S) - (C * 60 + 60) * (600 / S^2)\n\nSimplifying and setting dT/dS = 0, we get:\n\n(1/60) * S - (C * 60 + 60) * (1 / S^2) = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 60 * S^2, we get:\n\nS^3 - (C * 60 + 60) * 60 = 0\n\nSubstituting the expression for C again, we get:\n\nS^3 - ((1/3600) * S^2 * 60 + 60) * 60 = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nS^3 - S^2 + 3600 = 0\n\nThis is a cubic equation in S. We can solve it numerically to find the value of S that minimizes the total expenditure. The solution is approximately S = 45 kmph.\n\nNow we can find the minimum expenditure by substituting this value of S back into the equation for T:\n\nT = (C * 60 + 60) * (600 / 45)\n\nSubstituting the expression for C, we get:\n\nT = ((1/3600) * (45)^2 * 60 + 60) * (600 / 45)\n\nCalculating the value of T, we get:\n\nT \u2248 1200\n\nSo the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 Km is approximately $1200.\n\nThe final answer is {1200}.",

        "Response": "There are two events that we need to consider: selecting 3 good bulbs and 1 defective bulb.\n\nThere are 5 good bulbs and 4 defective bulbs in the box. We need to find the number of ways to select 3 good bulbs out of 5 and 1 defective bulb out of 4.\n\nThe number of ways to select 3 good bulbs out of 5 is given by the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be selected.\n\nSo, the number of ways to select 3 good bulbs out of 5 is: C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(2*1)) = 10\n\nSimilarly, the number of ways to select 1 defective bulb out of 4 is: C(4, 1) = 4! / (1!(4-1)!) = 4! / (1!3!) = (4*3*2*1) / ((1)*(3*2*1)) = 4\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to select 4 bulbs out of 9. This is given by: C(9, 4) = 9! / (4!(9-4)!) = 9! / (4!5!) = (9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((4*3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1)) = 126\n\nThe probability of selecting exactly 3 good bulbs and 1 defective bulb is the ratio of the number of ways to select 3 good bulbs and 1 defective bulb to the total number of ways to select 4 bulbs out of 9.\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to select 3 good bulbs and 1 defective bulb) / (Total number of ways to select 4 bulbs out of 9)\n\nProbability = (10 * 4) / 126 = 40 / 126\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.\n\nProbability = (40 / 2) / (126 / 2) = 20 / 63\n\nSo, the probability that exactly three bulbs are good is 20/63.\n\nThe final answer is {20/63}.",

However, the letter 'M' is repeated twice. \n\nTo find the number of ways to arrange the letters, we can use the formula for permutations of a set with duplicate items: n!/(p1! * p2! * ... * pk!), where n is the total number of items, and p1, p2, ..., pk are the number of times each duplicate item is repeated.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 (total number of letters) and p1 = 2 (the number of times 'M' is repeated).\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the letters is:\n\n6! / (2!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1) = 720 / 2 = 360\n\nTherefore, there are 360 different ways to arrange the letters of the word 'ARMOUM'.\n\nThe final answer is {360}.",

Since the second person has covered 60 km, the biker has to travel 300 - 60 = 240 km to reach them. This takes 240/50 = 4.8 hours.\n\n4. The biker takes the second person across the remaining 240 km stretch. This takes another 240/50 = 4.8 hours.\n\n5. During these 4.8 hours, the last person has been running at 10 kmph.

        "Response": "First, let's find out how much bigger the executive car tank is compared to the sports car tank. Since the executive car tank is 75% bigger, we can calculate the size of the executive car tank as follows:\n\nExecutive car tank = Sports car tank + (75% of Sports car tank)\nExecutive car tank = 32 + (0.75 * 32)\nExecutive car tank = 32 + 24\nExecutive car tank = 56 liters\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of fuel for each type of car:\n\nCost of fuel for sports car = 32 liters * $0.4/liter = $12.8\nCost of fuel for executive car = 56 liters * $0.4/liter = $22.4\n\nSince there are 2 sports cars and 2 executive cars, the total cost of fuel for all cars is:\n\nTotal cost of fuel = (2 * $12.8) + (2 * $22.4) = $25.6 + $44.8 = $70.4\n\nNow, let's calculate the service cost for all cars:\n\nService cost for all cars = 4 cars * $1.15/car = $4.6\n\nFinally, let's add the total cost of fuel and the service cost to find the total cost to fuel all cars:\n\nTotal cost = Total cost of fuel + Service cost for all cars\nTotal cost = $70.4 + $4.6 = $75\n\nSo, the total cost to fuel all cars together is $75.\n\nThe final answer is {75}.",

        "Response": "Let's calculate the amount invested by A and B for the entire year.\n\nA invested Rs.4000 for the first 4 months. After 4 months, he withdrew three-fourth of his capital, which means he left one-fourth of his capital in the business. So, A's remaining capital is (1/4) * 4000 = Rs.1000. This amount is invested for the remaining 8 months.\n\nSo, A's total investment for the year is (4000 * 4) + (1000 * 8) = 16000 + 8000 = Rs.24000.\n\nB invested Rs.6000 for the first 8 months. After 8 months, he withdrew half of his capital, which means he left half of his capital in the business. So, B's remaining capital is (1/2) * 6000 = Rs.3000. This amount is invested for the remaining 4 months.\n\nSo, B's total investment for the year is (6000 * 8) + (3000 * 4) = 48000 + 12000 = Rs.60000.\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of their investments: A : B = 24000 : 60000 = 2 : 5.\n\nSo, they should share the profits in the ratio 2 : 5.\n\nThe final answer is {A}.",

So, the total work done by 15 women in 55 days can be represented as:\n\n15W * 55 = Total Work\n\nSimilarly, 10 men can complete the project in 55 days. So, the total work done by 10 men in 55 days can be represented as:\n\n10M * 55 = Total Work\n\nSince both groups complete the same project, we can equate the two expressions:\n\n15W * 55 = 10M * 55\n\nDivide both sides by 55:\n\n15W = 10M\n\nNow, we need to find the time taken by 5 women and 4 men working together to complete the project. Let the number of days be x. So, the total work done by 5 women and 4 men in x days can be represented as:\n\n(5W + 4M) * x = Total Work\n\nWe know that 15W = 10M, so we can substitute this into the equation:\n\n(5 * (10M/15) + 4M) * x = 10M * 55\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n(10M/3 + 4M) * x = 10M * 55\n\nDivide both sides by 10M:\n\n(1/3 + 4/3) * x = 55\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(5/3) * x = 55\n\nMultiply both sides by 3/5:\n\nx = 55 * (3/5)\n\nx = 33\n\nSo, 5 women and 4 men working together can complete the project in 33 days.\n\nAnswer: {33}.",

        "Response": "Let the volume of the cistern be V liters. \n\nPipe A can fill the cistern in 10 minutes, so its rate is V/10 liters per minute.\nPipe B can fill the cistern in 15 minutes, so its rate is V/15 liters per minute.\n\nLet the rate of the waste pipe be W liters per minute.\n\nWhen both pipes A and B are open along with the waste pipe, the net rate of filling the cistern is (V/10 + V/15 - W) liters per minute.\n\nThe cistern should have been full, but due to the waste pipe being open, it took an additional 4 minutes to fill the cistern. So, the volume filled in these 4 minutes is 4 * (V/10 + V/15 - W).\n\nAfter closing the waste pipe, it took another 4 minutes to fill the cistern completely. In these 4 minutes, pipes A and B together filled the remaining volume, which is 4 * (V/10 + V/15).\n\nNow, we can set up an equation:\n\n4 * (V/10 + V/15 - W) + 4 * (V/10 + V/15) = V\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n4 * (V/10 + V/15 - W) = V - 4 * (V/10 + V/15)\n\n4 * (V/10 + V/15 - W) = V * (1 - 4/10 - 4/15)\n\n4 * (V/10 + V/15 - W) = V * (1/2)\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\nV/10 + V/15 - W = V/2\n\nNow, we can solve for W:\n\nW = V/10 + V/15 - V/2\n\nW = (3V/30 + 2V/30 - 15V/30)\n\nW = (5V - 15V)/30\n\nW = -10V/30\n\nW = -V/3\n\nSince the rate of the waste pipe is negative, it means that it empties the cistern. To find the time it takes to empty the cistern, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Volume / Rate\n\nTime = V / (-W)\n\nTime = V / (V/3)\n\nTime = 3\n\nSo, the waste pipe can empty the cistern in 3 minutes.\n\nHowever, this answer is not in the given options.

        "Response": "Let's denote the position of the hour hand as H and the position of the minute hand as M. We know that at 8 o'clock, the hour hand is at 8/12 = 2/3 of the way between the 8 and 9 on the clock, and the minute hand is at 0.\n\nWe want to find the time when the hands are in the same straight line but not together. This means that the angle between the hands is either 0 degrees (together) or 180 degrees (opposite). Since we want the hands to be not together, we are looking for the time when the angle between the hands is 180 degrees.\n\nThe position of the hour hand H can be represented as 2/3 + t/12, where t is the time in hours after 8 o'clock. The position of the minute hand M can be represented as t, since it moves at a constant rate of 1 hour per hour.\n\nThe angle between the hands is proportional to the absolute difference between their positions: |H - M|. We want this angle to be 180 degrees, which corresponds to a difference of 1/2 on the clock (since 360 degrees corresponds to a full circle, or a difference of 1).\n\nSo we have the equation:\n\n|2/3 + t/12 - t| = 1/2\n\nWe can solve this equation for t:\n\n2/3 + t/12 - t = 1/2\nt/12 - t = -1/6\nt(1 - 12) = -1/6\nt = -1/6 / -11\nt = 1/66\n\nSo the time between 8 and 9 o'clock when the hands are in the same straight line but not together is 1/66 of an hour after 8 o'clock. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:\n\ntime in minutes = 1/66 * 60 = 60/11\n\nSo the answer is {60/11} minutes after 8 o'clock. The correct option is B) 10x10/11.",

In 8.5 seconds, the train covers a distance equal to the distance covered by the second person in 8.5 seconds.\n\nDistance covered by the train in 8.5 seconds = (x - 5.4) * (8.5/3600) km\nDistance covered by the second person in 8.5 seconds = 5.4 * (8.5/3600) km\n\nSince both distances are equal, we can write the equation:\n(x - 5.4) * (8.5/3600) = 5.4 * (8.5/3600)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nx - 5.4 = 5.4\nx = 10.8\n\nNow, we have two values of x: 9 and 10.8. Since both persons are walking in the same direction as the train, the speed of the train should be greater than the speed of both persons. Therefore, the speed of the train is 10.8 km/hr.\n\nHowever, the options given are in multiples of 6, so we need to convert the speed of the train to a multiple of 6.

The first train has travelled 400 + 100 = 500 km.\n\nThe distance between P and Q is the sum of the distances travelled by both trains, which is 400 + 500 = 900 km.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is {900}.",

Let's try dividing by the next prime number, 3:\n\n1023 \u00f7 3 = 341\n\nSo, 1023 = 3 \u00d7 341. Now we need to find the prime factors of 341. It is not divisible by 3, so let's try the next prime number, 5. It is not divisible by 5 either. The next prime number is 7, and 341 is not divisible by 7. The next prime number is 11, and 341 is not divisible by 11. The next prime number is 13, and 341 is not divisible by 13. The next prime number is 17, and:\n\n341 \u00f7 17 = 20\n\nSo, 341 = 17 \u00d7 20. Now we need to find the prime factors of 20. It is divisible by 2:\n\n20 \u00f7 2 = 10\n\nSo, 20 = 2 \u00d7 10. Now we need to find the prime factors of 10. It is divisible by 2:\n\n10 \u00f7 2 = 5\n\nSo, 10 = 2 \u00d7 5.\n\nNow we have found all the prime factors of 1023: 1023 = 3 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5. The greatest prime factor is 17.\n\nThe answer is {A}.",

We can notice that 55 is a multiple of 11 and 99 is also a multiple of 11 (11 * 5 and 11 * 9). So, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 11: (55/11) / (99/11) = 5/9.\n\nNow, we can easily convert 5/9 to a decimal by performing the division 5 \u00f7 9. We get the decimal 0.5\u0305, which means that the decimal repeats every digit after the decimal point. Since the repeating part is just one digit long, the 3000th digit to the right of the decimal place will be the same as the first digit to the right of the decimal place, which is 5.\n\nSo, the 3000th digit to the right of the decimal place is 5.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{C}.",

So, the speed downstream is 21 kmph + 5 kmph = 26 kmph.\n\nNow, we need to convert the speed from kmph to meters per second. To do this, we can use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = (1000/3600) m/s.\n\nSo, the speed downstream in meters per second is 26 * (1000/3600) = 26 * (5/18) = 65/9 m/s.\n\nNow, we can use the formula time = distance/speed to find the time he takes to cover 90 meters.\n\nTime = 90 / (65/9) = 90 * (9/65) = 9 * (90/65) = 9 * (18/13) = 9 * 1.3846 = 12.46 seconds.\n\nSo, the man will take 12.46 seconds to cover 90 meters downstream.\n\nThe final answer is {12.46}.",

The next smallest prime number is 3, but 435,961 is not divisible by 3 either. The next smallest prime number is 5, but 435,961 is not divisible by 5. The next smallest prime number is 7, and 435,961 is divisible by 7. \n\n435,961 \u00f7 7 = 62,279\n\nNow we need to find the prime factorization of 62,279. It is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, but it is divisible by 7.\n\n62,279 \u00f7 7 = 8,897\n\nNow we need to find the prime factorization of 8,897. It is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it is divisible by 13.\n\n8,897 \u00f7 13 = 685\n\nNow we need to find the prime factorization of 685. It is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, but it is divisible by 13.\n\n685 \u00f7 13 = 53\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 435,961 is 7^3 * 13^2.\n\nSince 21^k is a divisor of 435,961, we know that 21^k = 7^k * 3^k must be a factor of 7^3 * 13^2. Since there is no factor of 3 in the prime factorization of 435,961, k must be 0. Therefore, 7^k - k^7 = 7^0 - 0^7 = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nSo the answer is B)1.\n\nFinal answer: {1}.",

",
        "Response": "First, we need to find the surface area of the cube. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square with an area of side length squared. Since the cube has edges of 10 feet, the area of one face is 10*10 = 100 square feet. So, the total surface area of the cube is 6*100 = 600 square feet.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many quarts of paint are needed to cover the 600 square feet. Since one quart covers 1200 square feet, we can find the proportion of a quart needed by dividing the surface area by the coverage per quart: 600/1200 = 0.5 quarts.\n\nFinally, we need to find the cost of 0.5 quarts of paint. Since paint costs $3.20 per quart, the cost of 0.5 quarts is 0.5*$3.20 = $1.60.\n\nSo, the cost to paint the outside of the cube is $1.60.\n\nThe final answer is {A) $1.60}.",

        "Response": "Let the weight of the full bottle be F and the weight of the empty bottle be E. We know that E = (1/6)F.\n\nWhen some water is removed, the weight of the bottle becomes (1/3)F. Let the weight of the removed water be R. So, the weight of the remaining water and the empty bottle is F - R.\n\nNow, we can write the equation:\n\nE + (F - R) = (1/3)F\n\nSubstitute E with (1/6)F:\n\n(1/6)F + (F - R) = (1/3)F\n\nNow, we need to find R in terms of F:\n\n(1/6)F + F - R = (1/3)F\n(1/6)F + F = (1/3)F + R\n(7/6)F = (1/3)F + R\n\nNow, we can find R:\n\nR = (7/6)F - (1/3)F\nR = (4/6)F\nR = (2/3)F\n\nSo, the weight of the removed water is (2/3) of the full bottle's weight. To find the percentage of water removed, we can divide the weight of the removed water by the weight of the full bottle and multiply by 100:\n\nPercent of water removed = (R/F) * 100\nPercent of water removed = ((2/3)F/F) * 100\nPercent of water removed = (2/3) * 100\nPercent of water removed = 66.67%\n\nHowever, this is the percentage of the total weight of the bottle, including the empty bottle's weight. We need to find the percentage of water removed from the initial water weight. The initial water weight is F - E = F - (1/6)F = (5/6)F.\n\nNow, we can find the percentage of water removed from the initial water weight:\n\nPercent of water removed = (R/((5/6)F)) * 100\nPercent of water removed = ((2/3)F/((5/6)F)) * 100\nPercent of water removed = (2/3)/(5/6) * 100\nPercent of water removed = (2/3)*(6/5) * 100\nPercent of water removed = 80%\n\nSo, the percent of water removed is 80%.\n\nThe final answer is {80%}.",

        "Response": "Let's denote James' initial retirement savings as S. On January 1, 2011, he invests 0.8S in largecaps, 0.1S in midcaps, and 0.1S in smallcaps.\n\nIn 2011, the largecaps rise 10%, so his investment in largecaps becomes 0.8S * 1.1 = 0.88S. The midcaps rise 10%, so his investment in midcaps becomes 0.1S * 1.1 = 0.11S. The smallcaps rise 20%, so his investment in smallcaps becomes 0.1S * 1.2 = 0.12S.\n\nIn 2012, the largecaps fall 5%, so his investment in largecaps becomes 0.88S * 0.95 \u2248 0.836S. The midcaps fall 10%, so his investment in midcaps becomes 0.11S * 0.9 \u2248 0.099S. The smallcaps rise x%, so his investment in smallcaps becomes 0.12S * (1 + x/100).\n\nOn January 1, 2013, his total retirement savings is the same as it was two years before, so we have:\n\nS = 0.836S + 0.099S + 0.12S * (1 + x/100)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nS = 0.935S + 0.12S * (1 + x/100)\n\nDivide both sides by S:\n\n1 = 0.935 + 0.12 * (1 + x/100)\n\nSubtract 0.935 from both sides:\n\n0.065 = 0.12 * (1 + x/100)\n\nDivide both sides by 0.12:\n\n0.54167 \u2248 1 + x/100\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-0.45833 \u2248 x/100\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\nx \u2248 -45.833\n\nSince x is the percentage increase in smallcaps in 2012, it cannot be negative.

        "Response": "Let the volumes of the two cones be V1 and V2, and their radii be r1 and r2, respectively. We are given that V1/V2 = 1/10 and r1/r2 = 1/2.\n\nThe volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the cones have the same height, we can write the volume ratio as:\n\nV1/V2 = (1/3)\u03c0r1^2h / (1/3)\u03c0r2^2h = r1^2 / r2^2\n\nWe are given that r1/r2 = 1/2, so (r1/r2)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Therefore, r1^2 / r2^2 = 1/4.\n\nNow we can equate the volume ratio and the radius ratio:\n\n1/10 = 1/4\n\nTo solve for the length of the wire, we need to find the ratio of the slant heights of the cones. The slant height of a cone is given by the formula l = \u221a(r^2 + h^2), where l is the slant height, r is the radius, and h is the height.\n\nLet the slant heights of the two cones be l1 and l2. We can write the ratio of the slant heights as:\n\nl1/l2 = \u221a(r1^2 + h^2) / \u221a(r2^2 + h^2)\n\nWe know that r1/r2 = 1/2, so r1 = r2/2. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:\n\nl1/l2 = \u221a((r2/2)^2 + h^2) / \u221a(r2^2 + h^2)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n(l1/l2)^2 = ((r2/2)^2 + h^2) / (r2^2 + h^2)\n\nNow we can substitute the radius ratio into this equation:\n\n(l1/l2)^2 = ((1/2)^2 + h^2) / (1^2 + h^2)\n\n(l1/l2)^2 = (1/4 + h^2) / (1 + h^2)\n\nTo solve for the length of the wire, we need to find the value of (l1/l2)^2. We can do this by substituting the volume ratio into the equation above:\n\n1/10 = (1/4 + h^2) / (1 + h^2)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10(1 + h^2), we get:\n\n10 = 10(1/4 + h^2) / (1 + h^2)\n\n10(1 + h^2) = 10(1/4 + h^2)\n\n10 = 2.5 + 10h^2\n\n7.5 = 10h^2\n\nh^2 = 0.75\n\nNow we can substitute this value back into the equation for (l1/l2)^2:\n\n(l1/l2)^2 = (1/4 + 0.75) / (1 + 0.75)\n\n(l1/l2)^2 = 1 / 1.75\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nl1/l2 = \u221a(1 / 1.75) \u2248 2/3\n\nSo the length of the wire is in the ratio 2:3.\n\nThe final answer is {C)4:3}.",

        "Response": "First, we need to find out how many units are rented. Since 4 out of every 7 units are rented, we can find the number of rented units by multiplying the total number of units (441) by 4/7:\n\n441 * (4/7) = 252 units are rented.\n\nNow, we know that 1/5 of the one-bedroom units are rented. Let x be the total number of one-bedroom units. Then, (1/5)x units are rented. Since there is a 6:1 ratio of two-bedroom units to one-bedroom units among the rented apartments, we can write the following equation:\n\n(1/5)x + 6(1/5)x = 252\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n(7/5)x = 252\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (5/7) * 252\nx = 180\n\nSo, there are 180 one-bedroom units in total.

So, the sum of the three greatest temperatures is less than 5x.\n\nNow, let's look at the answer choices:\n\nA) 6x: This is greater than 5x, so it cannot be the sum of the three greatest temperatures.\n\nB) 4x: This is less than 5x, so it could be the sum of the three greatest temperatures.\n\nC) 5x/3: This is less than 5x, so it could be the sum of the three greatest temperatures.\n\nD) 3x/2: This is less than 5x, so it could be the sum of the three greatest temperatures.\n\nE) 3x/5: This is less than 5x, so it could be the sum of the three greatest temperatures.\n\nHowever, we need to find the sum Z of the 3 greatest temperatures, which is c + d + e. Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact values of a, b, c, d, and e, we cannot find the exact value of Z.

Let the speed of Usha be U m/s and the speed of Shiny be S m/s.\n\nSince Usha beats Shiny by 50 m in a 1000 m race, we can write the equation:\n\n1000/U = (1000 - 50)/S\n1000/U = 950/S\n\nNow let's find the time it takes for Shiny to complete the race and beat Mercy.\n\nLet the time taken by Shiny to beat Mercy be T seconds. Since Mercy runs at 4 m/s, in T seconds, Mercy will cover a distance of 4T meters.\n\nSince Shiny beats Mercy, the distance covered by Shiny in T seconds will be 1000 meters. So, we can write the equation:\n\nS * T = 1000\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, U and S:\n\n1) 1000/U = 950/S\n2) S * T = 1000\n\nWe can solve these equations to find the value of T.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can write S in terms of U:\n\nS = 950U/1000 = 19U/20\n\nSubstitute this value of S in equation 2:\n\n(19U/20) * T = 1000\n\nT = 1000 * 20 / 19U\n\nNow we know that Usha completes the race in 1000/U seconds.

To find the total number of votes enrolled (x), we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.45:\n\nx = 10000 / 0.45\nx = 22222.22 (approximately)\n\nSince the number of votes must be a whole number, we can round this value to the nearest whole number, which is 22222.\n\nSo, the total number of votes enrolled in that election is approximately 22222.\n\nThe final answer is {22222}.",

        "Query": "A license plate in the country Kerrania consists of four digits followed by two letters. The letters A, B, and C are used only by government vehicles while the letters D through Z are used by non-government vehicles. Kerrania's intelligence agency has recently captured a message from the country Gonzalia indicating that an electronic transmitter has been installed in a Kerrania government vehicle with a license plate starting with 79. If it takes the police 9 minutes to inspect each vehicle, what is the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours?\nOptions:  A)18/79 B)1/6 C)1/45 D)1/50 E)1/900 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide the explanation followed by the answer.. ",
        "Response": "There are 3 letters (A, B, and C) that can be used for government vehicles, and there are 10 digits (0-9) that can be used for each of the other two digits in the license plate. Since the license plate starts with 79, there are 3 * 10 * 10 = 300 possible license plates for government vehicles starting with 79.\n\nIn three hours, there are 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Since it takes 9 minutes to inspect each vehicle, the police can inspect 180 / 9 = 20 vehicles in three hours.\n\nThe probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours is the number of vehicles they can inspect divided by the total number of possible government vehicles starting with 79. This is 20 / 300 = 1/15.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in the calculation. We should have considered that there are only 2 digits left to be filled in the license plate, not 3. So, the correct calculation for the total number of possible government vehicles starting with 79 is 3 * 10 * 1 = 30.\n\nNow, the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours is 20 / 30 = 2/3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 2/3, which is not among the given options.

Therefore, the product 6n(n + 1) must be divisible by 2.\n\nAlso, either n or (n + 1) must be divisible by 3. This is because if n is not divisible by 3, then it must have a remainder of 1 or 2 when divided by 3. If the remainder is 1, then (n + 1) is divisible by 3. If the remainder is 2, then (n + 1) has a remainder of 0 when divided by 3, which means it is divisible by 3.

",
        "Response": "Let the capacities of the four barrels be A, B, Q, and R, with A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R. Since the median is 10 gallons, we know that B + Q = 20. The average capacity is 8 gallons, so the total capacity is 4 * 8 = 32 gallons. Therefore, A + B + Q + R = 32.\n\nNow we want to maximize the capacity of the smallest barrel, Q. To do this, we need to minimize the capacities of the other barrels. Since A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R, we know that A \u2264 B and B \u2264 Q. We also know that B + Q = 20, so the smallest possible value for B is 10 (since B \u2264 Q). If B = 10, then Q = 10 as well.\n\nNow we have A + 10 + 10 + R = 32, so A + R = 12. Since A \u2264 R, the smallest possible value for A is 6. If A = 6, then R = 6 as well.\n\nSo the capacities of the barrels are A = 6, B = 10, Q = 10, and R = 6. The maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel Q is 10 gallons.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our calculations. We assumed that the smallest possible value for A is 6, but we need to find the maximum possible capacity for Q, not A. So let's try a smaller value for A.\n\nIf A = 1, then we have 1 + B + Q + R = 32, and B + Q = 20. So B = 9 and Q = 11. But this doesn't satisfy the condition that A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R, since 1 \u2264 9 \u2264 11 \u2264 R is not true.\n\nIf A = 2, then we have 2 + B + Q + R = 32, and B + Q = 20. So B = 8 and Q = 12. But this also doesn't satisfy the condition that A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R, since 2 \u2264 8 \u2264 12 \u2264 R is not true.\n\nIf A = 3, then we have 3 + B + Q + R = 32, and B + Q = 20. So B = 7 and Q = 13. But this also doesn't satisfy the condition that A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R, since 3 \u2264 7 \u2264 13 \u2264 R is not true.\n\nIf A = 4, then we have 4 + B + Q + R = 32, and B + Q = 20. So B = 6 and Q = 14. But this also doesn't satisfy the condition that A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R, since 4 \u2264 6 \u2264 14 \u2264 R is not true.\n\nIf A = 5, then we have 5 + B + Q + R = 32, and B + Q = 20. So B = 5 and Q = 15. This satisfies the condition that A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R, since 5 \u2264 5 \u2264 15 \u2264 R is true.\n\nSo the maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel Q is 15 gallons. However, this is not one of the options given. We made another mistake in our calculations. We assumed that the median is 10 gallons, but the median is actually the average of the two middle numbers, which is (B + Q) / 2 = 10. So B + Q = 20, not B + Q = 10.\n\nNow we have A + B + Q + R = 32, and B + Q = 20. So A + R = 12. Since A \u2264 R, the smallest possible value for A is 1. If A = 1, then R = 11.\n\nSo the capacities of the barrels are A = 1, B = 9, Q = 11, and R = 11. The maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel Q is 11 gallons.

        "Response": "To ensure that 80 of the books removed are on the same science, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. This would be if we remove books from all the sciences in such a way that we don't have 80 books from any one science yet. \n\nIn this case, we would remove 49 books from botany, 74 books from zoology, 89 books from physics, 49 books from geology, and 79 books from chemistry. This would give us a total of 49 + 74 + 89 + 49 + 79 = 340 books removed.\n\nNow, if we remove one more book, we are guaranteed to have 80 books from at least one of the sciences.

So, the work done by the pipe in 1 hour is 1/a.\n\nWith the leakage, the pipe takes 7 times longer to fill the tank, which is 7a hours. In this case, the work done by the pipe and the leakage together in 1 hour is 1/(7a).\n\nSince the pipe is filling the tank and the leakage is emptying it, the work done by the leakage in 1 hour is the difference between the work done by the pipe alone and the work done by the pipe and the leakage together.\n\nSo, the work done by the leakage in 1 hour is (1/a) - (1/(7a)).\n\nNow, let's find the time taken by the leakage to empty the tank, which is x hours.

        "Response": "Let's first find the expression for David's earnings for last week and this week.\n\nLast week, he sold x bicycles. So, his earnings were:\n40 + 6 * min(x, 6) + 12 * max(0, min(x - 6, 6)) + 18 * max(0, x - 12)\n\nThis week, he sold y bicycles. So, his earnings were:\n40 + 6 * min(y, 6) + 12 * max(0, min(y - 6, 6)) + 18 * max(0, y - 12)\n\nAccording to the problem, his earnings this week were more than twice his earnings last week:\n40 + 6 * min(y, 6) + 12 * max(0, min(y - 6, 6)) + 18 * max(0, y - 12) > 2 * (40 + 6 * min(x, 6) + 12 * max(0, min(x - 6, 6)) + 18 * max(0, x - 12))\n\nNow let's analyze the statements:\n\nI. y < 2x\nThis statement is not necessarily true. For example, if David sold 5 bicycles last week and 11 bicycles this week, his earnings would be $70 last week and $142 this week, which is more than twice his earnings last week. In this case, y = 11 and x = 5, so y > 2x.\n\nII. y > x\nThis statement must be true. If David sold the same number of bicycles or fewer this week compared to last week, his earnings would not be more than twice his earnings last week. So, he must have sold more bicycles this week.\n\nIII. y > 3\nThis statement must be true. If David sold 3 or fewer bicycles this week, his earnings would be at most $58 (if he sold 3 bicycles). In order for his earnings to be more than twice his earnings last week, he would have to earn less than $29 last week, which is not possible since his fixed salary is $40.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D) II, III only.",

After picking a white ball, there are now 4 red balls and 8 balls in total, so the probability of picking a red ball second is 4/8. Therefore, the probability of this case is (5/9)*(4/8) = 20/72.\n\nCase 2: The first ball is red and the second ball is white.\nThe probability of picking a red ball first is 4/9 (since there are 4 red balls and 9 balls in total).

        "Response": "Let the four numbers be a, b, c, and d. We are given that their average is 40, so the sum of the four numbers is 4 * 40 = 160. We are also given that the first number, a, is one-fourth of the sum of the last three numbers, b, c, and d. So, a = (b + c + d) / 4.\n\nSince the sum of the four numbers is 160, we have a + b + c + d = 160. We can substitute the expression for a from the previous equation into this equation to get (b + c + d) / 4 + b + c + d = 160.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 4, we get b + c + d + 4b + 4c + 4d = 640.\n\nCombining like terms, we get 5b + 5c + 5d = 640.\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get b + c + d = 128.\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into the equation for a: a = (b + c + d) / 4 = 128 / 4 = 32.\n\nSo, the first number is 32.\n\nThe final answer is {32}.",

        "Response": "Let's first find out how far the cyclist travels in the 5 minutes after passing the hiker. Since the cyclist is traveling at 28 miles per hour, we can convert this to miles per minute by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n28 miles/hour * (1 hour/60 minutes) = 28/60 = 7/15 miles/minute\n\nNow, we can find out how far the cyclist travels in 5 minutes:\n\n7/15 miles/minute * 5 minutes = 35/15 miles = 7/3 miles\n\nSince the hiker is walking at a constant rate of 7 miles per hour, we can also convert this to miles per minute:\n\n7 miles/hour * (1 hour/60 minutes) = 7/60 miles/minute\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes for the hiker to travel the 7/3 miles that the cyclist traveled in the 5 minutes. To do this, we can set up a proportion:\n\n(7/60 miles/minute) / x minutes = 7/3 miles\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n7x = 180\n\nDividing both sides by 7, we get:\n\nx = 180/7 = 25.71 minutes\n\nSince the cyclist has already waited for 5 minutes, we need to subtract this from the total time it takes for the hiker to catch up:\n\n25.71 minutes - 5 minutes = 20.71 minutes\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, the cyclist must wait for approximately 21 more minutes for the hiker to catch up.

        "Response": "The capacity of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. \n\nFor tank A, we are given the height $h_A = 10$ meters and the circumference $C_A = 12$ meters. We can find the radius $r_A$ using the formula for the circumference of a circle: $C = 2\\pi r$.

We are given that A can give B a 100-meter start and C a 200-meter start in a 1-kilometer (1000-meter) race. This means that A can cover the 1000 meters in the same time it takes B to cover 900 meters and C to cover 800 meters.\n\nUsing the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time, we can write the following equations:\n\n1000 = Va \u00d7 t\n900 = Vb \u00d7 t\n800 = Vc \u00d7 t\n\nWe want to find the distance B can give C, so we need to find the ratio of their speeds. We can do this by dividing the second equation by the third equation:\n\n(900 = Vb \u00d7 t) / (800 = Vc \u00d7 t)\n\n900/800 = (Vb \u00d7 t) / (Vc \u00d7 t)\n\n9/8 = Vb / Vc\n\nNow we know the ratio of their speeds. To find the distance B can give C, we need to find the distance B can cover in the same time it takes C to cover 1000 meters. Let's call this distance x:\n\nx = Vb \u00d7 t'\n\n1000 = Vc \u00d7 t'\n\nWe can now use the ratio of their speeds to substitute Vb in terms of Vc:\n\nVb = (9/8) \u00d7 Vc\n\nNow substitute this back into the equation for x:\n\nx = ((9/8) \u00d7 Vc) \u00d7 t'\n\nNow we can divide the equation for x by the equation for 1000 meters:\n\nx / 1000 = (((9/8) \u00d7 Vc) \u00d7 t') / (Vc \u00d7 t')\n\nx / 1000 = (9/8) \u00d7 (t' / t')\n\nSince t' and t are the same (the time it takes C to cover 1000 meters), we can cancel them out:\n\nx / 1000 = 9/8\n\nNow solve for x:\n\nx = 1000 \u00d7 (9/8)\n\nx = 1125\n\nSo B can give C a 1125 - 1000 = 125-meter start in a 1-kilometer race.

        "Query": "In a certain mathematical activity, we have five cards with five different prime numbers on them. We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n Provide the explanation followed by the answer.. ",
        "Response": "Let's first consider the number of ways to distribute the cards among the envelopes. We can represent this distribution using stars and bars method. We have 5 cards (stars) and 2 dividers (bars) to separate the envelopes. So, there are C(7, 2) = 21 ways to distribute the cards.\n\nNow, let's consider the prime factorization of the product of the cards in each envelope. Since there are 5 different prime numbers, there are 2^5 = 32 possible products (including the empty product, which corresponds to an empty envelope). However, we need to subtract 1 from this count because we cannot have all three envelopes empty. So, there are 31 possible products.\n\nFor each distribution of cards, we can have at most 3 distinct products (one for each envelope). So, there are at most 3 * 21 = 63 possible ordered triples of products. However, we need to divide this count by 3! = 6 because the order of the products does not matter. So, there are at most 63 / 6 = 10.5 possible unordered triples of products. Since the number of possible unordered triples must be an integer, there are at most 10 possible unordered triples.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of K sets. A K set is determined by the unordered triple of products. For each unordered triple, there are 3! = 6 ways to order the products. So, there are at most 6 * 10 = 60 possible K sets.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted some K sets. In particular, we have overcounted the K sets where two of the products are equal. There are C(5, 2) = 10 ways to choose a pair of cards to be equal, and for each pair, there are 2 ways to order the products (either the equal products are the first and second numbers, or they are the second and third numbers). So, there are 10 * 2 = 20 overcounted K sets.\n\nTherefore, the total number of K sets is 60 - 20 = 40. However, we need to add 1 to this count because we have not counted the K set where all three products are equal (i.e., all three envelopes are empty). So, the final answer is 40 + 1 = 41.\n\nThus, the answer is A) 41. The final answer is {41}.",

Now we can find the remainder when s is divided by t.\n\ns = 8415\nt = 100\n\ns % t = 8415 % 100 = 15\n\nSo the remainder when s is divided by t is 15. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We can try to simplify the fraction 8415/100 to see if there is another equivalent fraction with a smaller remainder.\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 8415 and 100 is 5. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to get an equivalent fraction:\n\n8415/5 = 1683\n100/5 = 20\n\nSo, s/t = 1683/20. Now we can find the remainder when s is divided by t:\n\ns = 1683\nt = 20\n\ns % t = 1683 % 20 = 3\n\nSo the remainder when s is divided by t is 3. This is still not one of the answer choices. We can try to simplify the fraction 1683/20 further.\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 1683 and 20 is 1, so the fraction 1683/20 is already in simplest form. Therefore, there is no equivalent fraction with a smaller remainder, and none of the answer choices are correct.\n\nHowever, if we made an error in the problem statement and the given fraction was s/t = 84.12 instead of s/t = 84.15, then we would have:\n\ns/t = 84.12\ns/t = 8412/100\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 8412 and 100 is 4. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get an equivalent fraction:\n\n8412/4 = 2103\n100/4 = 25\n\nSo, s/t = 2103/25. Now we can find the remainder when s is divided by t:\n\ns = 2103\nt = 25\n\ns % t = 2103 % 25 = 3\n\nSo the remainder when s is divided by t is 3. This is still not one of the answer choices, but it is closer to the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the given answer choices are correct for the original problem statement. However, if the problem statement was slightly different (s/t = 84.12), then the remainder when s is divided by t would be 3.",

This is a combination problem since the order in which the freshers are chosen does not matter. \n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 freshers from 12 players is given by the formula for combinations: \n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of players (12), k is the number of freshers to be chosen (5), and ! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1).\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!(12-5)!)\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5!7!)\n\nNow, we can calculate the factorials:\n\n12! = 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 479001600\n5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n7! = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 5040\n\nNow, we can plug these values back into the formula:\n\nC(12, 5) = 479001600 / (120 \u00d7 5040)\n\nC(12, 5) = 479001600 / 604800\n\nC(12, 5) = 792\n\nSo, there are 792 different ways for the coach to choose the 5 freshers.\n\nThe final answer is {792}.",

        "Response": "Let the length of the rectangle be L meters and the breadth be B meters. According to the problem, the difference between the length and breadth is 10 meters, so we can write:\n\nL - B = 10  (1)\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(L + B). In this case, the perimeter is 206 meters, so we can write:\n\n206 = 2(L + B)  (2)\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of L and B. First, let's solve equation (1) for L:\n\nL = B + 10  (3)\n\nNow substitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n\n206 = 2((B + 10) + B)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n103 = B + 10 + B\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n103 = 2B + 10\n\nSubtract 10 from both sides:\n\n93 = 2B\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nB = 46.5\n\nNow that we have the value of B, we can find the value of L using equation (3):\n\nL = 46.5 + 10\n\nL = 56.5\n\nNow that we have the values of L and B, we can find the area of the rectangle using the formula A = L * B:\n\nA = 56.5 * 46.5\n\nA = 2624.25\n\nSince the answer choices are all integers, we can round the area to the nearest integer:\n\nA \u2248 2624\n\nSo the area of the rectangle is approximately 2624 square meters.

        "Response": "We know that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. In this case, the sum of the digits is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, which is divisible by 3. So, any arrangement of these digits will form a number divisible by 3.\n\nHowever, we have a constraint that the number must be a five-digit number. This means that the first digit cannot be 0. So, we have 5 choices for the first digit (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n\nOnce we have chosen the first digit, we have 5 remaining digits to choose from for the second digit.

        "Response": "We are given the equation (12)^3 x 6^3 \u00f7 432 = y.\n\nFirst, we can rewrite 12 as 2^2 x 3 and 6 as 2 x 3. So, the equation becomes:\n\n(2^2 x 3)^3 x (2 x 3)^3 \u00f7 432 = y\n\nNow, we can use the power of a product property, which states that (ab)^n = a^n x b^n. Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\n(2^6 x 3^3) x (2^3 x 3^3) \u00f7 432 = y\n\nNext, we can use the product of powers property, which states that a^m x a^n = a^(m+n). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\n2^9 x 3^6 \u00f7 432 = y\n\nNow, we can rewrite 432 as 2^4 x 3^3. So, the equation becomes:\n\n2^9 x 3^6 \u00f7 (2^4 x 3^3) = y\n\nNow, we can use the quotient of powers property, which states that a^m \u00f7 a^n = a^(m-n). Applying this property to our equation, we get:\n\n2^(9-4) x 3^(6-3) = y\n\nSimplifying the exponents, we get:\n\n2^5 x 3^3 = y\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of y:\n\ny = 32 x 27 = 864\n\nSo, the value of y is 864.\n\nThe final answer is {864}.",

There are 10 possible units digits (0 through 9), and half of them are odd, so there are 5 numbers with an odd units digit in this range.\n\n2.

        "Response": "Let the capitals of B and C be Rs. x and Rs. y respectively.\n\nThe ratio of the capitals of A, B, and C is 2000 : x : y.\n\nSince the profit is divided in the ratio of their capitals, we can write the shares of A, B, and C as follows:\n\nA's share = (2000 / (2000 + x + y)) * 600\nB's share = (x / (2000 + x + y)) * 600\nC's share = (y / (2000 + x + y)) * 600\n\nWe are given that A's share is Rs. 200 and C's share is Rs. 130.
