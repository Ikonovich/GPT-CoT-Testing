        "Response": "There are a total of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose 3 chairs for the 3 persons to sit in. We will use complementary counting to find the probability that the couple does sit together, and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability that they do not sit together.\n\nIf the couple does sit together, there are 3 possible pairs of adjacent chairs for them to sit in: the first and second chairs, the second and third chairs, or the third and fourth chairs. For each of these pairs, there are 2 ways for the couple to sit (either the first person in the couple sits in the left chair and the second person sits in the right chair, or vice versa). Finally, there are 3 remaining chairs for the single person to sit in. So there are a total of $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 18$ ways for the couple to sit together.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where the couple sits in the second and third chairs, because this case was counted twice: once when we considered the pair of the first and second chairs, and once when we considered the pair of the third and fourth chairs. There are 2 ways for the couple to sit in the second and third chairs, and 2 remaining chairs for the single person to sit in, so there are a total of $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ ways for the couple to sit in the second and third chairs.\n\nThus, there are $18 - 4 = 14$ ways for the couple to sit together, and the probability that they do sit together is $\\frac{14}{10} = \\frac{7}{5}$.

If 8 customers are selected, what are the chances that at least 1 customer bought a coffee and a bagel?\nOptions:  A)27/343 B)3/7 C)27/125 D)199/245 E)9/125 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n ",
        "Response": "Let A be the event that a customer buys a bagel, and B be the event that a customer buys a coffee. We are given that P(A) = 3/5 and P(B) = 5/7. We want to find the probability of A \u2229 B, which is the event that a customer buys both a bagel and a coffee.\n\nWe can use the complementary probability to find the probability of A \u2229 B. The complementary event of A \u2229 B is A' \u222a B', which is the event that a customer does not buy both a bagel and a coffee. We can find the probability of A' \u222a B' using the formula:\n\nP(A' \u222a B') = P(A') + P(B') - P(A' \u2229 B')\n\nSince A' is the event that a customer does not buy a bagel, P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Similarly, B' is the event that a customer does not buy a coffee, so P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 5/7 = 2/7.\n\nNow we need to find the probability of A' \u2229 B', which is the event that a customer does not buy a bagel and does not buy a coffee. Since the events A and B are not mutually exclusive, we cannot simply multiply their probabilities. However, we can use the formula:\n\nP(A' \u2229 B') = P(A') * P(B' | A')\n\nWe know that P(A') = 2/5, but we need to find P(B' | A'), which is the probability that a customer does not buy a coffee given that they did not buy a bagel. Since we do not have enough information to find this probability directly, we will assume that the events A and B are independent. This means that P(B' | A') = P(B') = 2/7.\n\nNow we can find the probability of A' \u2229 B':\n\nP(A' \u2229 B') = P(A') * P(B' | A') = (2/5) * (2/7) = 4/35\n\nNow we can find the probability of A' \u222a B':\n\nP(A' \u222a B') = P(A') + P(B') - P(A' \u2229 B') = (2/5) + (2/7) - (4/35) = 14/35 + 10/35 - 4/35 = 20/35\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of A \u2229 B using the complementary probability:\n\nP(A \u2229 B) = 1 - P(A' \u222a B') = 1 - 20/35 = 15/35\n\nNow we want to find the probability that at least 1 out of 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee. We can use the complementary probability again, which is the probability that none of the 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee. Since the events are independent, we can simply raise the probability of a single customer not buying both a bagel and a coffee to the power of 8:\n\nP(None of the 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee) = (20/35)^8 = 2562890625/78364164096\n\nNow we can find the probability that at least 1 out of 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee:\n\nP(At least 1 out of 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee) = 1 - P(None of the 8 customers buys both a bagel and a coffee) = 1 - 2562890625/78364164096 = 75801263471/78364164096\n\nThe closest answer choice to this probability is D) 199/245.\n\nSo, the final answer is {D}.",

So, we get:\n\n(24W / 36 days) + (21W / 36 days) = (45W / 36 days)\n\nNow, we need to find how many days it will take for 6 women and 7 children to complete the work at this combined rate. We can set up the equation:\n\n(45W / 36 days) * T = W\n\nWhere T is the number of days it will take for 6 women and 7 children to complete the work.

        "Response": "Let the consumption of diesel per hour be C litres and the speed of the bus be S kmph. We are given that C varies directly as the square of S, so we can write C = kS^2, where k is the constant of variation.\n\nWhen the bus is travelling at 60 kmph, its consumption is 1 litre per hour. So, we can write 1 = k(60)^2. Solving for k, we get k = 1/3600.\n\nNow, let's find the speed at which the bus should travel to minimize the expenditure. The total expenditure per hour can be written as E = 60C + 60, where E is the expenditure per hour and C is the consumption of diesel per hour.\n\nSubstituting the value of C from the equation C = kS^2, we get E = 60(kS^2) + 60.\n\nNow, we need to minimize the expenditure E with respect to the speed S. To do this, we can differentiate E with respect to S and set the derivative equal to 0.\n\ndE/dS = 60(2kS) = 0\n\nSolving for S, we get S = 0. However, this solution doesn't make sense in this context, as the bus needs to travel at a non-zero speed to cover the distance. So, we need to find the minimum value of E for S > 0.\n\nTo do this, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of E with respect to S is:\n\nd^2E/dS^2 = 60(2k)\n\nSince k > 0, the second derivative is positive, which means that the function E(S) is convex and has a minimum value for S > 0.\n\nNow, let's find the minimum value of E. Since E = 60(kS^2) + 60, we can write E = 60(1/3600)(S^2) + 60.\n\nTo minimize E, we need to minimize the term S^2. Since the bus needs to cover a distance of 600 km, the minimum value of S^2 is (600/10)^2 = 3600.\n\nSubstituting this value of S^2 into the equation for E, we get E = 60(1/3600)(3600) + 60 = 60 + 60 = 120.\n\nSo, the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km is $120.\n\nThe final answer is {120}.",

We want to find the probability of having 0 women in the committee, which corresponds to the last scenario.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 persons from the group of 7 men and 6 women. This can be done using the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen.\n\nTotal number of ways to form a committee = C(13, 5) = 13! / (5! * 8!) = 1287\n\nNow let's find the number of ways to form a committee with 5 men and 0 women.

        "Response": "We can solve this problem using casework. Let's consider the possible values of E.\n\nCase 1: E = 1\nThere is only one way to have a sum of 1, which is to have a single 1 and the rest of the digits be 0. Since the first digit cannot be 0, there is only 1 way to arrange the digits: 10000.\n\nCase 2: E = 3\nThere are two ways to have a sum of 3: either a single 3 and the rest of the digits be 0, or three 1's and the rest of the digits be 0. If there is a single 3, there are 4 ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there are three 1's, there are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). So there are a total of 8 ways in this case.\n\nCase 3: E = 5\nThere are three ways to have a sum of 5: either a single 5 and the rest of the digits be 0, two 1's and a 3, or five 1's. If there is a single 5, there are 4 ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there are two 1's and a 3, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there are five 1's, there is only 1 way to arrange the digits. So there are a total of 11 ways in this case.\n\nCase 4: E = 7\nThere are four ways to have a sum of 7: either a single 7 and the rest of the digits be 0, a 5 and a 1, a 3 and two 1's, or seven 1's. If there is a single 7, there are 4 ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there is a 5 and a 1, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there is a 3 and two 1's, there are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there are seven 1's, there are no ways to arrange the digits since there are only 5 digits. So there are a total of 14 ways in this case.\n\nCase 5: E = 9\nThere are five ways to have a sum of 9: either a single 9 and the rest of the digits be 0, a 7 and a 1, a 5 and a 3, a 3 and three 1's, or nine 1's. If there is a single 9, there are 4 ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there is a 7 and a 1, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there is a 5 and a 3, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there is a 3 and three 1's, there are $\\binom{4}{4} = 1$ ways to arrange the digits (since the first digit cannot be 0). If there are nine 1's, there are no ways to arrange the digits since there are only 5 digits.

Since the numbers are distinct, we can have 5 options for the ten-thousands place, 4 options for the thousands place, 3 options for the hundreds place, 2 options for the tens place, and 1 option for the units place.

Since the concentration of raw material B is 50%, there must be 864 * 0.5 = 432 units of raw material B in the final mixture.\n\nNow let's find the amount of raw material B in product M. Since chemical X has a ratio of 1 : 3 for raw materials A and B, there are 3 units of raw material B for every 4 units of chemical X. Similarly, since chemical Y has a ratio of 2 : 1 for raw materials B and C, there are 2 units of raw material B for every 3 units of chemical Y.\n\nProduct M is produced by mixing chemical X and chemical Y in the ratio of 5 : 4. So for every 9 units of product M, there are 5 units of chemical X and 4 units of chemical Y.

Since there are 6 hardbacks, we will choose 3 hardbacks from the 6 available.\n\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!) = 6! / (3!3!) = (6*5*4) / (3*2*1) = 20\n\nNow, we can find the number of possible selections of 3 books that include at least one paperback by subtracting the number of selections without any paperbacks from the total number of possible selections.\n\n56 - 20 = 36\n\nSo, there are 36 possible selections of 3 books that include at least one paperback.\n\nThe final answer is {c) 36}.",

This time is 40 minutes (or 2/3 hours) less than the original time, so we can write the equation:\n\n(d/x) - (d/(x+3)) = 2/3\n\nIf the man moved 2 kmph slower, his speed would be (x-2) kmph and the time taken would be (d/(x-2)) hours.

So, the total work done by 10 men in 55 days is 10M * 55.\n\nSince both groups can complete the project in the same amount of time, we can equate the total work done by both groups:\n\n15W * 55 = 10M * 55\n\nDivide both sides by 55:\n\n15W = 10M\n\nNow, we need to find the amount of work done by 5 women and 4 men working together in 1 day.

Let this time be t minutes. In t minutes, pipe A can fill t/10 of the cistern, and pipe B can fill t/15 of the cistern.\n\nSince the waste pipe was also open during this time, the net amount of water filled in the cistern in t minutes is (t/10 + t/15 - t/x).\n\nAfter closing the waste pipe, it takes another 4 minutes for the cistern to be full. So, in these 4 minutes, the remaining part of the cistern is filled by pipes A and B together. This remaining part is equal to 1 - (t/10 + t/15 - t/x).\n\nNow, in 4 minutes, pipe A can fill 4/10 of the cistern, and pipe B can fill 4/15 of the cistern.

So, 7 days have 7 * 24 = 168 hours. From noon on Monday to 2 p.m. on the following Monday, 168 hours + 2 hours = 170 hours have passed.\n\nNow, let's find out how much the watch has gained during this time. The watch was 2 minutes low at noon on Monday and 4 minutes 48 seconds fast at 2 p.m. on the following Monday. So, the watch has gained 2 minutes + 4 minutes 48 seconds = 6 minutes 48 seconds.\n\nNow, let's find out how much the watch gains per hour. The watch gains 6 minutes 48 seconds in 170 hours. To find out how much it gains per hour, we can divide 6 minutes 48 seconds by 170 hours. \n\n6 minutes 48 seconds = 6 * 60 + 48 = 408 seconds\n\nSo, the watch gains 408 seconds / 170 hours = 2.4 seconds per hour.\n\nNow, let's find out when the watch was correct. The watch was 2 minutes low at noon on Monday. To find out when it was correct, we can divide 2 minutes by the gain per hour.\n\n2 minutes = 2 * 60 = 120 seconds\n\nSo, the watch was correct after 120 seconds / 2.4 seconds per hour = 50 hours.\n\nNow, let's find out when 50 hours after noon on Monday is. \n\nNoon on Monday + 50 hours = 2 p.m. on Wednesday\n\nSo, the watch was correct at 2 p.m. on Wednesday.

We also know that the price of the largest cake is $y+5x=24.50$. We can solve this system of equations to find $x$ and $y$.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get $5y+10x=85$. Dividing both sides by 5, we get $y+2x=17$. Now we can subtract the second equation from this new equation to get $x=17-24.50=-7.50$. However, this is not a valid answer since the price of a cake cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.\n\nLet's try solving the system of equations again. We have $6y+15x=109.50$ and $y+5x=24.50$. Multiplying the second equation by 5, we get $5y+25x=122.50$. Subtracting the first equation from this new equation, we get $-y+10x=13$.

        "Response": "Let the speed of the train be x km/hr.\n\nWhen the train is overtaking the first person, the relative speed between them is (x - 4.5) km/hr. The distance covered by the train in 8.4 seconds is the same as the distance covered by the first person in 8.4 seconds. So, we can write the equation:\n\nDistance covered by train = Distance covered by first person\n8.4 * (x - 4.5) = 8.4 * 4.5\n\nSimilarly, when the train is overtaking the second person, the relative speed between them is (x - 5.4) km/hr. The distance covered by the train in 8.5 seconds is the same as the distance covered by the second person in 8.5 seconds. So, we can write the equation:\n\nDistance covered by train = Distance covered by second person\n8.5 * (x - 5.4) = 8.5 * 5.4\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n8.4 * (x - 4.5) = 8.4 * 4.5\n8.5 * (x - 5.4) = 8.5 * 5.4\n\nSolving the first equation for x, we get:\n\nx - 4.5 = 4.5\nx = 9\n\nNow, substituting the value of x in the second equation, we get:\n\n8.5 * (9 - 5.4) = 8.5 * 5.4\n8.5 * 3.6 = 8.5 * 5.4\n\nDividing both sides by 8.5, we get:\n\n3.6 = 5.4\n\nThis is not possible, so there must be some mistake in the given data or the options provided. However, if we assume that the time taken to overtake the second person is 8.4 seconds instead of 8.5 seconds, then the equations become:\n\n8.4 * (x - 4.5) = 8.4 * 4.5\n8.4 * (x - 5.4) = 8.4 * 5.4\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\nx - 4.5 = 4.5\nx = 9\n\nx - 5.4 = 5.4\nx = 10.8\n\nNow, the average speed of the train is:\n\n(9 + 10.8) / 2 = 9.9 km/hr\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options.

So, there are 13 + 4 - 1 = 16 cards that are either a diamond or a king.\n\nThe probability of drawing a diamond or a king is the number of favorable outcomes (16) divided by the total number of outcomes (52). So, the probability is 16/52, which simplifies to 4/13.\n\nThe final answer is {4/13}.",

        "Response": "We first find the possible values of x and y. Since $(x+1)^2 \\le 16$, we have $x+1 \\le 4$ and $x+1 \\ge -4$. This gives us $x \\le 3$ and $x \\ge -5$, so the possible values of x are $-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\nSimilarly, since $(y-1)^2 < 64$, we have $y-1 < 8$ and $y-1 > -8$. This gives us $y < 9$ and $y > -7$, so the possible values of y are $-7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.\n\nNow we want to find the maximum and minimum possible values of xy. To maximize xy, we can either have a large positive value of x and a large positive value of y, or a large negative value of x and a large negative value of y. The largest positive value of x is 3, and the largest positive value of y is 8, so one possibility is $xy = 3 \\cdot 8 = 24$. The largest negative value of x is -5, and the largest negative value of y is -7, so another possibility is $xy = (-5) \\cdot (-7) = 35$. Since 35 is larger than 24, the maximum possible value of xy is 35.\n\nTo minimize xy, we can either have a large positive value of x and a large negative value of y, or a large negative value of x and a large positive value of y. The largest positive value of x is 3, and the largest negative value of y is -7, so one possibility is $xy = 3 \\cdot (-7) = -21$. The largest negative value of x is -5, and the largest positive value of y is 8, so another possibility is $xy = (-5) \\cdot 8 = -40$. Since -40 is smaller than -21, the minimum possible value of xy is -40.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the maximum and minimum possible values of xy is $35 + (-40) = \\boxed{-5}$.",

        "Response": "Let x be the number of floors David travels up and y be the number of floors Albert travels down. We can set up the following equation:\n\n11 + x = 51 - y\n\nSince they are traveling at different rates, we can also set up an equation for the time it takes for them to cross paths:\n\nx/57 = y/63\n\nNow we can solve for x and y. First, we can solve the second equation for y:\n\ny = 63x/57\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n11 + x = 51 - (63x/57)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 57 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n57(11 + x) = 57(51) - 63x\n\n627 + 57x = 2907 - 63x\n\nAdding 63x to both sides:\n\n120x = 2280\n\nDividing both sides by 120:\n\nx = 19\n\nNow we can substitute this value of x back into the equation for y:\n\ny = 63(19)/57\n\ny = 21\n\nSo David travels up 19 floors and Albert travels down 21 floors. To find the floor where their paths cross, we can add the number of floors David travels to his starting floor:\n\n11 + 19 = 30\n\nSo their paths cross at the 30th floor. The final answer is {C}.",

        "Response": "First, we need to find out how many units are rented. Since 4 out of every 7 units are rented, we can find the number of rented units by multiplying the total number of units by 4/7:\n\n441 * (4/7) = 252 units are rented.\n\nNow, we know that 1/5 of the one-bedroom units are rented. Let x be the total number of one-bedroom units. Then, the number of rented one-bedroom units is x/5.\n\nSince there is a 6:1 ratio of two-bedroom units to one-bedroom units among the rented apartments, we can write the following equation:\n\n(6 * (x/5)) / (x/5) = 252 / (x/5)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 35\n\nSo, there are 35 one-bedroom units in total.

        "Response": "First, let's find out the interest Manoj paid to Anwar for borrowing Rs.4200 at 6% p.a. simple interest for three years.\n\nSimple Interest = (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time)/100\nInterest paid to Anwar = (4200 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 3)/100 = Rs.756\n\nNow, let's assume Manoj added Rs.x to the borrowed sum and lent it to Ramu at 9% p.a. simple interest for the same time. So, the total amount lent to Ramu is (4200 + x).\n\nNow, we know that Manoj gains Rs.824.85 by way of interest on the borrowed sum as well as his own amount from the whole transaction. So, the interest earned from Ramu should be the sum of the interest paid to Anwar and the gain of Manoj.\n\nInterest earned from Ramu = Interest paid to Anwar + Gain of Manoj\nInterest earned from Ramu = 756 + 824.85 = Rs.1580.85\n\nNow, let's find out the interest rate for the amount lent to Ramu.\n\nSimple Interest = (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time)/100\n1580.85 = ((4200 + x) \u00d7 9 \u00d7 3)/100\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n1580.85 = (1134 + 27x)/100\n158085 = 113400 + 2700x\nx = (158085 - 113400)/2700\nx = 44700/2700\nx = 16.55\n\nSo, Manoj added Rs.16.55 to the borrowed sum and lent it to Ramu.

        "Response": "Let the capacities of the four barrels be A, B, Q, and R, with A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R. Since the median is 10 gallons, we know that B + Q = 20. The average capacity is 8 gallons, so the total capacity is 4 * 8 = 32 gallons. Therefore, A + B + Q + R = 32.\n\nNow we want to maximize the capacity of the smallest barrel, Q. To do this, we need to minimize the capacities of the other barrels. Since A \u2264 B \u2264 Q \u2264 R, we can set A = B = R = Q - 1. This gives us the equation:\n\n(Q - 1) + (Q - 1) + Q + (Q - 1) = 32\n4Q - 4 = 32\n4Q = 36\nQ = 9\n\nHowever, this would mean that the median is not 10 gallons, so we need to adjust the capacities of the other barrels. We can set A = B = Q - 2 and R = Q + 1. This gives us the equation:\n\n(Q - 2) + (Q - 2) + Q + (Q + 1) = 32\n4Q - 3 = 32\n4Q = 35\nQ = 8.75\n\nAgain, this would mean that the median is not 10 gallons. The only other option is to set A = B = Q - 3 and R = Q + 2. This gives us the equation:\n\n(Q - 3) + (Q - 3) + Q + (Q + 2) = 32\n4Q - 4 = 32\n4Q = 36\nQ = 9\n\nThis time, the median is indeed 10 gallons, so the maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel Q is 9 gallons. However, since the answer choices are integers, we need to round down to the nearest integer, which is 8. Therefore, the maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel Q is 8 gallons.\n\nHowever, this would mean that A = B = 5, which is not an option in the answer choices. The next smallest possible value for Q is 7, which would mean that A = B = 6. This is also not an option in the answer choices. The next smallest possible value for Q is 6, which would mean that A = B = 7. This is also not an option in the answer choices. The next smallest possible value for Q is 5, which would mean that A = B = 8. This is an option in the answer choices, so the maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel Q is 5 gallons.\n\nSo the final answer is {E}.",

Since the combined rate of A, B, and C is the sum of their individual rates, we can write:\n\nRate of C = (Rate of A + B + C) - (Rate of A + B)\nRate of C = (W/5) - (W/7)\n\nTo solve for the rate of C, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

We are also given that the first number is one-fourth of the sum of the last three, so a = (b + c + d)/4.\n\nFirst, we can multiply both sides of the average equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction: a + b + c + d = 160.\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for a from the second equation into the first equation: (b + c + d)/4 + b + c + d = 160.\n\nTo solve for a, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fraction: b + c + d + 4b + 4c + 4d = 640.\n\nNow, we can combine like terms: 5b + 5c + 5d = 640.\n\nNext, we can factor out a 5 from the left side of the equation: 5(b + c + d) = 640.\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5: b + c + d = 128.\n\nSince a = (b + c + d)/4, we can substitute the value we found for b + c + d into the equation for a: a = (128)/4.\n\nFinally, we can divide to find the value of a: a = 32.\n\nSo, the first number is 32.

        "Response": "There are 3 vowels (A, E, I) and 4 consonants (S, T, R, X) in the word ASTERIX. We want to arrange the letters so that the vowels appear in alphabetic order.\n\nFirst, let's arrange the consonants. There are 4 consonants, so there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange them.\n\nNow, we need to place the vowels in the arrangement of consonants. Since the vowels must appear in alphabetic order, we can think of them as a single unit (AEI). We need to place this unit in the arrangement of consonants. There are 5 positions where we can place the unit (before the first consonant, between the first and second consonants, between the second and third consonants, between the third and fourth consonants, or after the fourth consonant).\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to arrange the consonants and 5 ways to place the vowels in the arrangement of consonants. Therefore, there are 24 * 5 = 120 ways to arrange the letters of the word ASTERIX so that the vowels appear in alphabetic order.\n\nThe answer is not in the given options. However, if we assume that the question meant to ask for the number of ways to arrange the letters so that the vowels appear in any order, then we can proceed as follows:\n\nThere are 7! ways to arrange the letters of the word ASTERIX without any restrictions. However, we have already counted the 120 ways in which the vowels appear in alphabetic order. So, there are 7! - 120 = 5040 - 120 = 4920 ways to arrange the letters so that the vowels do not appear in alphabetic order.\n\nNow, we can use complementary counting to find the number of ways in which the vowels can appear in any order. There are 3! ways to arrange the vowels, so there are 3! * 4920 = 6 * 4920 = 29520 ways to arrange the letters so that the vowels appear in any order.\n\nAgain, the answer is not in the given options.

During the special sale, the price is reduced by another 10%, so the new price is $0.9(0.65x) = 0.585x$.\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage increase required to restore the price to its original amount. Let the percentage increase be $y$. We can set up the equation:\n\n$0.585x * (1 + y/100) = x$\n\nDivide both sides by $0.585x$:\n\n$1 + y/100 = 1/0.585$\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n$y/100 = 1/0.585 - 1$\n\n$y/100 = 0.7094$\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\n$y = 70.94$\n\nSo, the price of the jacket must be increased by approximately 70.9% to restore it to its original amount.

        "Response": "Yukou has 20 space travel books, and the ratio of monster books to space travel books is 4:5. To find the number of monster books he has, we can set up a proportion:\n\n4/5 = x/20\n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply:\n\n5x = 4 * 20\n5x = 80\nx = 16\n\nSo Yukou has 16 monster books. Since he wants to read a book every week for a year, he needs a total of 52 books. He currently has 16 monster books + 20 space travel books = 36 books. He needs 52 - 36 = 16 more books.\n\nTo maintain the 4:5 ratio, we can set up another proportion:\n\n4/5 = y/(16+y)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n5y = 4 * (16+y)\n5y = 64 + 4y\ny = 64 - 4y\n\nAdding 4y to both sides, we get:\n\n9y = 64\ny = 64/9\n\nSince y must be a whole number, we can try different multiples of 9 to find the smallest number that will give us a whole number for y:\n\n9 * 1 = 9 (too small)\n9 * 2 = 18 (too small)\n9 * 3 = 27 (too small)\n9 * 4 = 36 (too small)\n9 * 5 = 45 (too small)\n9 * 6 = 54 (just right)\n\nSo he needs to buy 54 - 36 = 18 more books. To maintain the 4:5 ratio, we can divide 18 by 9:\n\n18/9 = 2\n\nSo he needs to buy 2 sets of 4 monster books and 5 space travel books. This means he needs to buy 2 * 4 = 8 monster books and 2 * 5 = 10 space travel books.\n\nThe final answer is {8 monster, 10 space}.",

        "Response": "There are 900 4-digit positive integers, and half of them are odd. So there are 450 odd 4-digit positive integers. Since every other odd integer is a multiple of 5, there are 225 odd 4-digit positive integers that are multiples of 5.\n\nNow we need to count how many of these have the digit 3. There are 3 cases:\n\n1) The integer has a 3 in the thousands place. There are 5 choices for the units digit (0, 1, 2, 4, 5), and 9 choices for each of the tens and hundreds digits.

        "Query": "In a certain mathematical activity, we have five cards with five different prime numbers on them. We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the \u201cnumber\u201d of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different K sets can be produced by this process?\nOptions:  A) 41 B) 89 C) 125 D) 243 E) 512 Place your final answer in squiggly brackets.\n ",
        "Response": "We can solve this problem using combinatorics. There are 5 prime numbers, and we want to distribute them among 3 envelopes. We can think of this as placing 2 dividers among the 5 prime numbers. For example, if we have the prime numbers P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, placing the dividers like this:\n\nP1 | P2 P3 | P4 P5\n\nwould mean that the first envelope contains P1, the second envelope contains P2 and P3, and the third envelope contains P4 and P5.\n\nThere are 6 spaces between and to the sides of the 5 prime numbers where we can place the dividers: before P1, between P1 and P2, between P2 and P3, between P3 and P4, between P4 and P5, and after P5. We need to choose 2 of these 6 spaces to place the dividers, which can be done in C(6,2) = 15 ways.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the cases where one of the envelopes is empty. If one of the envelopes is empty, then the dividers must be placed in consecutive spaces. There are 5 ways to do this: before P1 and between P1 and P2, between P1 and P2 and between P2 and P3, etc. So we have overcounted by 5 cases.\n\nTherefore, there are 15 - 5 = 10 ways to distribute the prime numbers among the envelopes. Now, we need to consider the order of the envelope numbers. Since the prime numbers are distinct, the envelope numbers will also be distinct. So there are 3! = 6 ways to order the envelope numbers.\n\nThus, there are 10 * 6 = 60 different sets that can be produced by this process. However, we have not yet considered the case where one of the envelopes is empty. In this case, there are 3 ways to choose which envelope is empty, and then 5 ways to distribute the remaining 4 prime numbers among the other 2 envelopes (since there are 4 spaces between and to the sides of the 4 prime numbers, and we need to choose 1 of these spaces to place the divider). So there are 3 * 5 = 15 sets where one of the envelopes is empty.\n\nFinally, we need to add the 60 sets where all envelopes are non-empty to the 15 sets where one of the envelopes is empty, giving us a total of 60 + 15 = 75 different sets that can be produced by this process.\n\nHowever, we have not yet considered the case where two of the envelopes are empty. In this case, there are C(3,2) = 3 ways to choose which two envelopes are empty, and then there is only 1 way to distribute the 5 prime numbers among the remaining envelope. So there are 3 * 1 = 3 sets where two of the envelopes are empty.\n\nFinally, we need to add the 75 sets where at most one envelope is empty to the 3 sets where two of the envelopes are empty, giving us a total of 75 + 3 = 78 different sets that can be produced by this process.\n\nHowever, we have not yet considered the case where all three envelopes are empty. In this case, there is only 1 set, which is the set {1, 1, 1}.\n\nFinally, we need to add the 78 sets where at most two envelopes are empty to the 1 set where all three envelopes are empty, giving us a total of 78 + 1 = 79 different sets that can be produced by this process.\n\nSo the answer is 79, which is not among the given options.

        "Response": "First, we need to find the total amount Louie has to pay back after three months.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = 1000(1 + 0.10/12)^(12 * 3/12)\nA = 1000(1 + 0.008333)^(3)\nA = 1000(1.008333)^3\nA = 1000(1.025125)\nA = 1025.125\n\nSo, the total amount Louie has to pay back is $1025.125.

        "Response": "The total purchase price is 100 * 8 1/8 = 100 * 65/8 = 812.5 dollars. The total selling price is 100 * 24 = 2400 dollars. The investor paid a 2 percent brokerage fee on both the total purchase price and the total selling price, so the fees are 0.02 * 812.5 = 16.25 dollars for the purchase and 0.02 * 2400 = 48 dollars for the sale. The net purchase price is 812.5 + 16.25 = 828.75 dollars, and the net selling price is 2400 - 48 = 2352 dollars. The investor's gain is 2352 - 828.75 = 1523.25 dollars.

        "Response": "We can use the rule that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 15, which is divisible by 3. So, we just need to count the number of ways to arrange these digits into a five-digit number.\n\nFirst, we have 5 choices for the first digit (it can't be 0). After choosing the first digit, we have 4 choices for the second digit, 3 choices for the third digit, 2 choices for the fourth digit, and 1 choice for the fifth digit. So, there are 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120 ways to arrange the digits.\n\nHowever, we have not used the digit 0 yet. We can place the 0 in any of the remaining 5 positions, so there are 5 ways to place the 0. For each of these ways, there are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the remaining digits. So, there are 5 * 24 = 120 ways to form a five-digit number with the 0 included.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to form a five-digit number divisible by 3 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition is W = 120 + 120 = 240. However, we have overcounted the cases where the number is divisible by 3 and has a 0 in the thousands place. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 such that the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 and the thousands digit is 0. So, we need to subtract these cases from our total.\n\nW = 240 - 6 = 234. However, we have still overcounted the cases where the number is divisible by 3 and has a 0 in the hundreds place. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 such that the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 and the hundreds digit is 0. So, we need to subtract these cases from our total.\n\nW = 234 - 6 = 228. Finally, we have still overcounted the cases where the number is divisible by 3 and has a 0 in the tens place. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 such that the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 and the tens digit is 0. So, we need to subtract these cases from our total.\n\nW = 228 - 6 = 222. So, the total number of ways to form a five-digit number divisible by 3 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition is W = 222.\n\nHowever, we have still overcounted the cases where the number is divisible by 3 and has a 0 in the units place. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 such that the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 and the units digit is 0. So, we need to subtract these cases from our total.\n\nW = 222 - 6 = 216. So, the total number of ways to form a five-digit number divisible by 3 using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repetition is W = 216.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{216}$.",

We have:\n\n5n = 5(15k + 8) = 75k + 40.\n\nNow, we can divide 75k by 6 to see if there is any remainder:\n\n75k = 6(12k + 3k) = 6(12k) + 6(3k).\n\nSince 6(12k) is divisible by 6, we only need to consider the remainder when 6(3k) is divided by 6. Since 3k is an integer, 6(3k) is divisible by 6, so there is no remainder.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 40 is divided by 6:\n\n40 = 6(6) + 4.\n\nSo, the remainder when 5n is divided by 6 is 4.

        "Response": "To solve the inequality 15x - 2/x > 1, we first need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the inequality by x:\n\n15x^2 - 2 > x\n\nNow, we want to get everything on one side of the inequality, so we'll subtract x from both sides:\n\n15x^2 - x - 2 > 0\n\nNow we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation 15x^2 - x - 2 = 0. We can do this by factoring or using the quadratic formula. In this case, factoring is a bit difficult, so we'll use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn our equation, a = 15, b = -1, and c = -2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (1 \u00b1 \u221a((-1)^2 - 4(15)(-2))) / (2(15))\n\nx = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(121)) / 30\n\nx = (1 \u00b1 11) / 30\n\nThe two roots are x = -1/3 and x = 2/5. Since we want to find the range of values for which the inequality is greater than 0, we need to test the intervals between the roots and the roots themselves:\n\n1. Test x < -1/3: Choose x = -1. Plugging this into the inequality, we get 15(-1) - 2/(-1) = -13, which is not greater than 1. So this interval does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n2. Test -1/3 < x < 2/5: Choose x = 0. Plugging this into the inequality, we get 15(0) - 2/0, which is undefined. So this interval does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n3. Test x > 2/5: Choose x = 1. Plugging this into the inequality, we get 15(1) - 2/1 = 13, which is greater than 1. So this interval satisfies the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the range of values for which the inequality is true is x > 2/5, which corresponds to option A.\n\nSo the final answer is {A}.",

So we have the equation:\n\n20/x = (20/(x+8))/2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n40 = 20(x+8)/(x(x+8))\n\n40x(x+8) = 20(x+8)\n\n2x(x+8) = x+8\n\n2x^2 + 16x = x^2 + 8x\n\nx^2 + 8x = 0\n\nx(x+8) = 0\n\nx = 0 or x = -8\n\nSince x cannot be negative, the time it took the runner to run the first half is x=0 hours. Therefore, the time it took her to run the second half is x+8 = 0+8 = 8 hours. The answer is B) 12.",

        "Response": "Let the total work be W. A and B together can finish the work in 40 days, so their combined work rate is W/40.\n\nThey worked together for 10 days, so the work completed in these 10 days is 10 * (W/40) = W/4.\n\nAfter B left, A worked for another 12 days to finish the remaining work. So, the remaining work is W - W/4 = 3W/4.\n\nLet A's work rate be A_rate. Then, A_rate * 12 = 3W/4.\n\nNow, we need to find A's work rate in terms of the total work W. We know that A and B together have a work rate of W/40. Since B left after 10 days, A must have a work rate of W/40 - B_rate.\n\nWe can write the equation for A's work rate as:\n\nA_rate = (W/40) - B_rate\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for A_rate into the equation for the remaining work:\n\n((W/40) - B_rate) * 12 = 3W/4\n\nNow, we can solve for B_rate:\n\n12(W/40 - B_rate) = 3W/4\nW/40 - B_rate = (3W/4) / 12\nB_rate = W/40 - (W/16)\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for B_rate back into the equation for A_rate:\n\nA_rate = (W/40) - (W/40 - W/16)\nA_rate = W/16\n\nNow, we can find the number of days A alone can finish the job by dividing the total work by A's work rate:\n\nDays = W / (W/16)\nDays = 16\n\nSo, A alone can finish the job in 16 days.\n\nThe final answer is {D}.",

        "Response": "To find the probability Q, we need to find the number of favorable arrangements and divide it by the total number of possible arrangements.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible arrangements of the letters in the word MEDITERRANEAN. There are 13 letters in the word, but some of them are repeated. There are 2 M's, 3 E's, 2 R's, 2 A's, and 2 N's. So, the total number of arrangements is:\n\n13! / (2! * 3! * 2! * 2! * 2!) = 6,227,020 / (2 * 6 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 6,227,020 / 96 = 64,863\n\nNow, let's find the number of favorable arrangements, i.e., those with E as the first letter and R as the last letter. We are left with 11 letters to arrange, with 2 E's, 2 A's, and 2 N's repeated. So, the number of favorable arrangements is:\n\n11! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 39,916,800 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 39,916,800 / 8 = 4,989,600\n\nFinally, let's find the probability Q:\n\nQ = (number of favorable arrangements) / (total number of arrangements) = 4,989,600 / 64,863 \u2248 1/13\n\nSo, the probability Q is approximately 1/13.

Therefore, 1001 * p must be divisible by 385. We can factor 1001 and 385 to find their prime factors:\n\n1001 = 7 * 11 * 13\n385 = 5 * 7 * 11\n\nNow we can see that the only way for 1001 * p to be divisible by 385 is if p = 5.
