So, the first layer will take a 5x5 image and output a 3x3 image.\n\nThe second layer will take a 3x3 image and output a 1x1 image. This is because the convolutional layer will reduce the size of the image by 2.\n\nSo, there are two layers.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the number of neurons in the first layer. We know that the input is a 5x5 image, and that the convolutional layer has a kernel size of 3x3. This means that the convolutional layer will reduce the size of the image by 2. So, the first layer will take a 5x5 image and output a 3x3 image.\n\nThe number of neurons in the first layer is 3x3 = 9.\n\nThe second layer will take a 3x3 image and output a 1x1 image.

We can do this by looking at the number in the tens place and subtracting it from 10. In this case, we have a 1 in the tens place, so 10 - 1 = 9.

We can see that there are 8 terms in the sequence.\n\nNext, we need to figure out the sum of the first 8 terms in the sequence. We can do this by adding up the first 8 terms in the sequence:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36\n\nFinally, we need to figure out the sum of the first 6 terms in the sequence. We can do this by adding up the first 6 terms in the sequence:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n\nTherefore, the sum of the first 8 terms in the sequence minus the sum of the first 6 terms in the sequence is 36 - 21 = 15.",
