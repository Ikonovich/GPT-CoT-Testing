{"Question": "A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?", "Answer": "On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.\nOn the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.\nThey pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day\nOn the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons\nMs. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons\nTogether, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons\nIn the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons\nThe amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons\n#### 6000", "Ground Truth": "6000", "Operators": "/*/*+/**/++-"}
