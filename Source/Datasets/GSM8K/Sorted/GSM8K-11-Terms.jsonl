{"Question": "Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?", "Answer": "Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.\nRose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.\nRose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.\nFinally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.\nRose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.\nBut the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.\nSo Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining\n#### 79", "Ground Truth": "79", "Operators": "****++++++-"}
{"Question": "Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?", "Answer": "First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.\nHalf of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.\n15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.\nThe remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.\nThat means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.\nHe also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.\nMTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500\nIn total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.\n#### 131250", "Ground Truth": "131250", "Operators": "***/--***++"}
